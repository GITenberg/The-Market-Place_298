    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE battle was over, and the victor remained on the field&mdash;sitting
      alone with the hurly-burly of his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      His triumph was so sweeping and comprehensive as to be somewhat shapeless
      to the view. He had a sense of fascinated pain when he tried to define to
      himself what its limits would probably be. Vistas of unchecked, expanding
      conquest stretched away in every direction. He held at his mercy
      everything within sight. Indeed, it rested entirely with him to say
      whether there should be any such thing as mercy at all&mdash;and until he
      chose to utter the restraining word the rout of the vanquished would go on
      with multiplying terrors and ruin. He could crush and torture and despoil
      his enemies until he was tired. The responsibility of having to decide
      when he would stop grinding their faces might come to weigh upon him later
      on, but he would not give it room in his mind to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      A picture of these faces of his victims shaped itself out of the flames in
      the grate. They were moulded in a family likeness, these phantom visages:
      they were all Jewish, all malignant, all distorted with fright. They
      implored him with eyes in which panic asserted itself above rage and
      cunning. Only here and there did he recall a name with which to label one
      of these countenances; very few of them raised a memory of individual
      rancour. The faces were those of men he had seen, no doubt, but their
      persecution of him had been impersonal; his great revenge was equally so.
      As he looked, in truth, there was only one face&mdash;a composite mask of
      what he had done battle with, and overthrown, and would trample implacably
      under foot. He stared with a conqueror's cold frown at it, and gave an
      abrupt laugh which started harsh echoes in the stillness of the Board
      Room. Then he shook off the reverie, and got to his feet. He shivered a
      little at the sudden touch of a chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bottle of brandy, surrounded by glasses, stood on the table where the
      two least-considered of his lieutenants, the dummy Directors, had left it.
      He poured a small quantity and sipped it. During the whole eventful day it
      had not occurred to him before to drink; the taste of the neat liquor
      seemed on the instant to calm and refresh his brain. With more
      deliberation, he took a cigar from the broad, floridly-decorated open box
      beside the bottle, lit it, and blew a long draught of smoke thoughtfully
      through his nostrils. Then he put his hands in his pockets, looked again
      into the fire, and sighed a wondering smile. God in heaven! it was
      actually true!
    </p>
    <p>
      This man of forty found himself fluttering with a novel exhilaration,
      which yet was not novel. Upon reflection, he perceived that he felt as if
      he were a boy again&mdash;a boy excited by pleasure. It surprised as much
      as it delighted him to experience this frank and direct joy of a child. He
      caught the inkling of an idea that perhaps his years were an illusion. He
      had latterly been thinking of himself as middle-aged; the grey hairs
      thickening at his temples had vaguely depressed him. Now all at once he
      saw that he was not old at all. The buoyancy of veritable youth bubbled in
      his veins. He began walking up and down the room, regarding new halcyon
      visions with a sparkling eye. He was no longer conscious of the hated foe
      beneath his feet; they trod instead elastic upon the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of someone moving about in the hallway outside, and of trying a
      door near by, suddenly caught his attention. He stood still and listened
      with alertness for a surprised instant, then shrugged his shoulders and
      began moving again. It must be nearly seven o'clock; although the
      allotment work had kept the clerks later than usual that day, everybody
      connected with the offices had certainly gone home. He realized that his
      nerves had played him a trick in giving that alarmed momentary start&mdash;and
      smiled almost tenderly as he remembered how notable and even glorious a
      warrant those nerves had for their unsettled state. They would be all
      right after a night's real rest. He would know how to sleep NOW, thank
      God!
    </p>
    <p>
      But yes&mdash;there was somebody outside&mdash;and this time knocking with
      assurance at the right door, the entrance to the outer office. After a
      second's consideration, he went into this unlighted outer office, and
      called out through the opaque glass an enquiry. The sound of his voice, as
      it analyzed itself in his own ears, seemed unduly peremptory. The answer
      which came back brought a flash of wonderment to his eyes. He hurriedly
      unlocked and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the lights in what I made out to be the Board Room,&rdquo; said the
      newcomer, as he entered. &ldquo;I assumed it must be you. Hope I don't interrupt
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could have given me greater pleasure, Lord Plowden,&rdquo; replied the
      other, leading the way back to the inner apartment. &ldquo;In fact, I couldn't
      have asked anything better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of his voice had a certain anxious note in it not quite in
      harmony with this declaration. He turned, under the drop-light overhanging
      the Board-table, and shook hands with his guest, as if to atone for this
      doubtful accent. &ldquo;I shake hands with you again,&rdquo; he said, speaking
      rapidly, &ldquo;because this afternoon it was what you may call formal; it
      didn't count. And&mdash;my God!&mdash;you're the man I owe it all to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mustn't go as far as that&mdash;even in the absence of
      witnesses,&rdquo; replied Lord Plowden, lightly. &ldquo;I'll take off my coat for a
      few minutes,&rdquo; he went on, very much at his ease. &ldquo;It's hot in here. It's
      by the merest chance I happened to be detained in the City&mdash;and I saw
      your lights, and this afternoon we had no opportunity whatever for a quiet
      talk. No&mdash;I won't drink anything before dinner, but I'll light a
      cigar. I want to say to you, Thorpe,&rdquo; he concluded, as he seated himself
      &ldquo;that I think what you've done is very wonderful. The Marquis thinks so
      too&mdash;but I shouldn't like to swear that he understands much about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The implication that the speaker did understand remained in the air like a
      tangible object. Thorpe took a chair, and the two men exchanged a silent,
      intent look. Their faces, dusky red on the side of the glow from the fire,
      pallid where the electric light fell slantwise upon them from above, had
      for a moment a mysterious something in common. Then the tension of the
      glance was relaxed&mdash;and on the instant no two men in London looked
      less alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden was familiarly spoken of as a handsome man. Thorpe had even
      heard him called the handsomest man in England&mdash;though this seemed in
      all likelihood an exaggeration. But handsome he undoubtedly was&mdash;tall
      without suggesting the thought of height to the observer, erect yet
      graceful, powerfully built, while preserving the effect of slenderness.
      His face in repose had the outline of the more youthful guardsman-type&mdash;regular,
      finely-cut, impassive to hardness. When he talked, or followed with
      interest the talk of others, it revealed almost an excess of animation.
      Then one noted the flashing subtlety of his glance, the swift facility of
      his smile and comprehending brows, and saw that it was not the guardsman
      face at all. His skin was fresh-hued, and there was a shade of warm brown
      in his small, well-ordered moustasche, but his hair, wavy and worn longer
      than the fashion, seemed black. There were perceptible veins of grey in
      it, though he had only entered his thirty-fifth year. He was dressed
      habitually with the utmost possible care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast between this personage and the older man confronting him was
      abrupt. Thorpe was also tall, but of a burly and slouching figure. His
      face, shrouded in a high-growing, dust-coloured beard, invited no
      attention. One seemed always to have known this face&mdash;thick-featured,
      immobile, undistinguished. Its accessories for the time being were even
      more than ordinarily unimpressive. Both hair and beard were ragged with
      neglect. His commonplace, dark clothes looked as if he had slept in them.
      The hands resting on his big knees were coarse in shape, and roughened,
      and ill-kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't have asked anything better than your dropping in,&rdquo; he repeated
      now, speaking with a drag, as of caution, on his words. &ldquo;Witnesses or no
      witnesses, I'm anxious to have you understand that I realize what I owe to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish it were a great deal more than it is,&rdquo; replied the other,
      with a frank smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it'll mount up to considerable, as it stands,&rdquo; said Thorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hear that there was a kind of reservation in his voice; the
      suspicion that his companion detected it embarrassed him. He found himself
      in the position of fencing with a man to whom all his feelings impelled
      him to be perfectly open. He paused, and was awkwardly conscious of
      constraint in the silence which ensued. &ldquo;You are very kind to put it in
      that way,&rdquo; said Lord Plowden, at last. He seemed also to be finding words
      for his thoughts with a certain difficulty. He turned his cigar round in
      his white fingers meditatively. &ldquo;I gather that your success has been
      complete&mdash;as complete as you yourself could have desired. I
      congratulate you with all my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;don't say my success&mdash;say our success,&rdquo; put in Thorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear man,&rdquo; the other corrected him, &ldquo;my interest, compared with
      yours, is hardly more than nominal. I'm a Director, of course, and I'm not
      displeased that my few shares should be worth something instead of
      nothing, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe lifted one of his heavy hands. &ldquo;That isn't my view of the thing at
      all. To be frank, I was turning over in my mind, just awhile ago, before
      you came in, some way of arranging all that on a different footing. If
      you'll trust it to me, I think you'll find it's all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in the form of this remark seemed to restore to Lord Plowden his
      accustomed fluency of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came here to say precisely that thing,&rdquo; he began&mdash;&ldquo;that I do trust
      it to you. We have never had any very definite talk on the subject&mdash;and
      pray don't think that I want to go into details now. I'd much rather not,
      in fact. But what I do want to say to you is this: I believe in you. I
      feel sure that you are going to go far, as the saying is. Well, I want to
      tie myself to your star. Do you see what I mean? You are going to be a
      power in finance. You are going to be able to make and unmake men as you
      choose. I should be very much obliged indeed if you would make me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe regarded the handsome and titled man of fashion with what seemed to
      the other a lethargic gaze. In truth, his mind was toiling with strenuous
      activity to master, in all its bearings, the significance of what had been
      said. This habit of the abstracted and lack-lustre eye, the while he was
      hard at work thinking, was a fortuitous asset which he had never up to
      that time learned that he possessed. Unconsciously, he dampened the
      spirits of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't imagine I'm trying to force myself upon you,&rdquo; Lord Plowden said,
      growing cool in the face of this slow stare. &ldquo;I'm asking nothing at all. I
      had the impulse to come and say to you that you are a great man, and that
      you've done a great thing&mdash;and done it, moreover, in a very great
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how it was done!&rdquo; The wondering exclamation forced itself from
      Thorpe's unready lips. He bent forward a little, and took a new visual
      hold, as it were, of his companion's countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden smiled. &ldquo;Did you think I was such a hopeless duffer, then?&rdquo;
       he rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer, Thorpe leant back in his chair, crossed his legs, and patted
      his knee contentedly. All at once his face had lightened; a genial
      speculation returned to his grey eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was in a curious position about you, you see,&rdquo; he began to
      explain. The relief with which he spoke was palpable. &ldquo;I could not for the
      life of me make up my mind whether to tell you about it or not. Let's see&mdash;this
      is Thursday; did I see you Tuesday? At any rate, the scheme didn't dawn on
      me myself until toward evening Tuesday. But yesterday, of course, I could
      have told you&mdash;and again this afternoon&mdash;but, as I say, I
      couldn't make up my mind. Once I had it on the tip of my tongue&mdash;but
      somehow I didn't. And you&mdash;you never gave me a hint that you saw what
      was going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Lord Plowden smiled. &ldquo;I voted with you,&rdquo; he put in softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe laughed, and relit his cigar. &ldquo;Well, I couldn't have asked anything
      better than this,&rdquo; he declared once again. &ldquo;It beats all the rest put
      together, to my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I don't quite follow your meaning,&rdquo; commented the other
      tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why man,&rdquo; Thorpe explained, hesitating a little in his choice of words,
      but speaking with evident fervour; &ldquo;I was more anxious about you&mdash;and
      the way you'd take it&mdash;than about anything else. I give you my word I
      was. I couldn't tell at all how you'd feel about the thing. You might
      think that it was all right, and then again you might round on me&mdash;or
      no, I don't mean quite that&mdash;but you might say it wasn't good enough
      for you, and wash your hands of the whole affair. And I can't tell you
      what a relief it is to find that you&mdash;that you're satisfied. Now I
      can go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;ahead,&rdquo; said the younger man, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Do you mind
      telling me&mdash;you see I'm quite in the dark as to details&mdash;how
      much further ahead we are likely to go? I comprehend the general nature of
      our advance&mdash;but how far off is the goal you have in sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; answered Thorpe, with a rising thrill of excitement in his
      voice. &ldquo;I don't give it any limit. I don't see why we should stop at all.
      We've got them in such a position that&mdash;why, good heavens! we can
      squeeze them to death, crush them like quartz.&rdquo; He chuckled grimly at the
      suggestion of his simile. &ldquo;We'll get more ounces to the ton out of our
      crushings than they ever heard of on the Rand, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I ask,&rdquo; interposed the other, &ldquo;who may 'they' be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe hesitated, and knitted his brows in the effort to remember names.
      &ldquo;Oh, there are a lot of them,&rdquo; he said, vaguely. &ldquo;I think I told you of
      the way that Kaffir crowd pretended to think well of me, and let me
      believe they were going to take me up, and then, because I wouldn't give
      them everything&mdash;the very shirt off my back&mdash;turned and put
      their knife into me. I don't know them apart, hardly&mdash;they've all got
      names like Rhine wines&mdash;but I know the gang as a whole, and if I
      don't lift the roof clean off their particular synagogue, then my name is
      mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden smiled. &ldquo;I've always the greatest difficulty to remember that
      you are an Englishman&mdash;a Londoner born,&rdquo; he declared pleasantly. &ldquo;You
      don't talk in the least like one. On shipboard I made sure you were an
      American&mdash;a very characteristic one, I thought&mdash;of some curious
      Western variety, you know. I never was more surprised in my life than when
      you told me, the other day, that you only left England a few years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hardly a 'few years'; more like fifteen,&rdquo; Thorpe corrected him. He
      studied his companion's face with slow deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to say something that you mustn't take amiss,&rdquo; he remarked,
      after a little pause. &ldquo;If you'd known that I was an Englishman, when we
      first met, there on the steamer, I kind o' suspect that you and I'd never
      have got much beyond a nodding acquaintance&mdash;and even that mostly on
      my side. I don't mean that I intended to conceal anything&mdash;that is,
      not specially&mdash;but I've often thought since that it was a mighty good
      thing I did. Now isn't that true&mdash;that if you had taken me for one of
      your own countrymen you'd have given me the cold shoulder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say there's a good deal in what you say,&rdquo; the other admitted,
      gently enough, but without contrition. &ldquo;Things naturally shape themselves
      that way, rather, you know. If they didn't, why then the whole position
      would become difficult. But you are an American, to all intents and
      purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;I never took any step towards getting naturalized,&rdquo; Thorpe
      protested. &ldquo;I always intended to come back here. Or no, I won't say that&mdash;because
      most of the time I was dog-poor&mdash;and this isn't the place for a poor
      man. But I always said to myself that if ever I pulled it off&mdash;if I
      ever found my self a rich man&mdash;THEN I'd come piking across the
      Atlantic as fast as triple-expansion engines would carry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man smiled again, with a whimsical gleam in his eye. &ldquo;And you
      ARE a rich man, now,&rdquo; he observed, after a momentary pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are both rich men,&rdquo; replied Thorpe, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held up a dissuading hand, as the other would have spoken. &ldquo;This is how
      it seems to me the thing figures itself out: It can't be said that your
      name on the Board, or the Marquis's either, was of much use so far as the
      public were concerned. To tell the truth, I saw some time ago that they
      wouldn't be. Titles on prospectuses are played out in London. I've rather
      a notion, indeed, that they're apt to do more harm than good&mdash;just at
      present, at least. But all that aside&mdash;you are the man who was civil
      to me at the start, when you knew nothing whatever about my scheme, and
      you are the man who was good to me later on, when I didn't know where to
      turn for a friendly word. Very well; here I am! I've made my coup! And I'd
      be a sweep, wouldn't I? to forget to-day what I was so glad to remember a
      week ago. But you see, I don't forget! The capital of the Company is
      500,000 pounds, all in pound shares. We offered the public only a fifth of
      them. The other four hundred thousand shares are mine as vendor&mdash;and
      I have ear-marked in my mind one hundred thousand of them to be yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden's face paled at the significance of these words. &ldquo;It is too
      much&mdash;you don't reflect what it is you are saying,&rdquo; he murmured
      confusedly. &ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; the other reassured him. &ldquo;Everything that
      I've said goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peer, trembling a little, rose to his feet. &ldquo;It is a preposterously
      big reward for the merest act of courtesy,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Of course it
      takes my breath away for joy&mdash;and yet I feel I oughtn't to be
      consenting to it at all. And it has its unpleasant side&mdash;it buries me
      under a mountain of obligation. I don't know what to do or what to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, leave the saying and doing to me, then,&rdquo; replied Thorpe, with a
      gesture before which the other resumed his seat. &ldquo;Just a word more&mdash;and
      then I suppose we'd better be going. Look at it in this way. Your
      grandfather was Lord Chancellor of England, and your father was a General
      in the Crimea. My grandfather kept a small second-hand book-shop, and my
      father followed him in the business. In one sense, that puts us ten
      thousand miles apart. But in another sense, we'll say that we like each
      other, and that there are ways in which we can be of immense use to each
      other, and that brings us close together. You need money&mdash;and here it
      is for you. I need&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;a kind of friendly lead
      in the matter of establishing myself on the right footing, among the right
      people&mdash;and that's what you can do for me. Mind&mdash;I'd prefer to
      put it all in quite another way; I'd like to say it was all niceness on
      your part, all gratitude on mine. But if you want to consider it on a
      business basis&mdash;why there you have it also&mdash;perfectly plain and
      clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up as he finished, and Lord Plowden rose as well. The two men shook
      hands in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the latter spoke, it was to say: &ldquo;Do you know how to open one of
      those soda-water bottles? I've tried, but I can never get the trick. I
      think I should like to have a drink&mdash;after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had put down their glasses, and the younger man was getting into
      his great-coat, Thorpe bestowed the brandy and cigars within a cabinet at
      the corner of the room, and carefully turned a key upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're going West, let me give you a lift,&rdquo; said Lord Plowden, hat in
      hand. &ldquo;I can set you down wherever you like. Unfortunately I've to go out
      to dinner, and I must race, as it is, to get dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe shook his head. &ldquo;No, go along,&rdquo; he bade him. &ldquo;I've some odds and
      ends of things to do on the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then when shall I see you?&rdquo;&mdash;began the other, and halted suddenly
      with a new thought in his glance. &ldquo;But what are you doing Saturday?&rdquo; he
      asked, in a brisker tone. &ldquo;It's a dies non here. Come down with me
      to-morrow evening, to my place in Kent. We will shoot on Saturday, and
      drive about on Sunday, if you like&mdash;and there we can talk at our
      leisure. Yes, that is what you must do. I have a gun for you. Shall we
      say, then&mdash;Charing Cross at 9:55? Or better still, say 5:15, and we
      will dine at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder man pondered his answer&mdash;frowning at the problem before him
      with visible anxiety. &ldquo;I'm afraid I'd better not come&mdash;it's very good
      of you all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; retorted the other. &ldquo;My mother will be very glad indeed to see
      you. There is no one else there&mdash;unless, perhaps, my sister has some
      friend down. We shall make a purely family party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe hesitated for only a further second. &ldquo;All right. Charing Cross,
      5:15,&rdquo; he said then, with the grave brevity of one who announces a
      momentous decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood still, looking into the fire, for a few moments after his
      companion had gone. Then, going to a closet at the end of the room, he
      brought forth his coat and hat; something prompted him to hold them up,
      and scrutinize them under the bright light of the electric globe. He put
      them on, then, with a smile, half-scornful, half-amused, playing in his
      beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The touch of a button precipitated darkness upon the Board Room. He made
      his way out, and downstairs to the street. It was a rainy, windy October
      night, sloppy underfoot, dripping overhead. At the corner before him, a
      cabman, motionless under his unshapely covered hat and glistening rubber
      cape, sat perched aloft on his seat, apparently asleep. Thorpe hailed him,
      with a peremptory tone, and gave the brusque order, &ldquo;Strand!&rdquo; as he
      clambered into the hansom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;LOUISA, the long and short of it is this,&rdquo; said Thorpe, half an hour
      later: &ldquo;you never did believe in me, as a sister should do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was seated alone with this sister, in a small, low, rather
      dismally-appointed room, half-heartedly lighted by two flickering gasjets.
      They sat somewhat apart, confronting a fireplace, where only the laid
      materials for a fire disclosed themselves in the cold grate. Above the
      mantel hung an enlarged photograph of a scowling old man. Thorpe's gaze
      recurred automatically at brief intervals to this portrait&mdash;which
      somehow produced the effect upon him of responsibility for the
      cheerlessness of the room. There were other pictures on the walls of which
      he was dimly conscious&mdash;small, faded, old prints about Dido and
      AEneas and Agamemnon, which seemed to be coming back to him out of the
      mists of his childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vagrant impressions and associations of this childhood strayed with quaint
      inconsequence across the field of his preoccupied mind. The peculiar odour
      of the ancient book-shop on the floor below remained like snuff in his
      nostrils. Somewhere underneath, or in the wainscoting at the side, he
      could hear the assiduous gnawing of a rat. Was it the same rat, he
      wondered with a mental grin, that used to keep him awake nights, in one of
      the rooms next to this, with that same foolish noise, when he was a boy?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you always say that,&rdquo; replied Louisa, impassively.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was years older than her brother, but, without a trace of artifice or
      intention, contrived to look the younger of the two. Her thick hair, drawn
      simply from her temples into a knot behind, was of that palest brown which
      assimilates grey. Her face, long, plain, masculine in contour and spirit,
      conveyed no message as to years. Long and spare of figure, she sat upright
      in her straight-backed chair, with her large, capable hands on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believed in you as much as you'd let me,&rdquo; she went on, indifferently,
      almost wearily. &ldquo;But I don't see that it mattered to you whether I did or
      didn't. You went your own way: you did what you wanted to do. What had I
      to do with it? I don't suppose I even knew what part of the world you were
      in more than once in two or three years. How should I know whether you
      were going to succeed, when I didn't even know what it was you were at?
      Certainly you hadn't succeeded here in London&mdash;but elsewhere you
      might or you might not&mdash;how could I tell? And moreover, I don't feel
      that I know you very well; you've grown into something very different from
      the boy Joel that left the shop&mdash;it must be twenty years ago. I can
      only know about you and your affairs what you tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my point is,&rdquo; pursued Thorpe, watching her face with a curiously
      intent glance, &ldquo;you never said to yourself: 'I KNOW he's going to succeed.
      I KNOW he'll be a rich man before he dies.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head dispassionately. Her manner expressed fatigued failure
      to comprehend why he was making so much of this purposeless point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I don't remember ever having said that to myself,&rdquo; she admitted,
      listlessly. Then a comment upon his words occurred to her, and she spoke
      with more animation: &ldquo;You don't seem to understand, Joel, that what was
      very important to you, didn't occupy me at all. You were always talking
      about getting rich; you kept the idea before you of sometime, at a stroke,
      finding yourself a millionaire. That's been the idea of your life. But
      what do I know about all that? My work has been to keep a roof over my
      head&mdash;to keep the little business from disappearing altogether. It's
      been hard enough, I can tell you, these last few years, with the big
      jobbers cutting the hearts out of the small traders. I had the invalid
      husband to support for between three and four years&mdash;a dead weight on
      me every week&mdash;and then the children to look after, to clothe and
      educate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the last word she hesitated suddenly, and looked at him. &ldquo;Don't think
      I'm ungrateful&rdquo;&mdash;she went on, with a troubled effort at a smile&mdash;&ldquo;but
      I almost wish you'd never sent me that four hundred pounds at all. What it
      means is that they've had two years at schools where now I shan't be able
      to keep them any longer. They'll be spoiled for my kind of life&mdash;and
      they won't have a fair chance for any other. I don't know what will become
      of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The profound apprehension in the mother's voice did not dull the gleam in
      Thorpe's eyes. He even began a smile in the shadows of his unkempt
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when I sent that money, for example, two years ago, and over,&rdquo; he
      persisted, doggedly&mdash;&ldquo;and I told you there'd be more where that came
      from, and that I stood to pull off the great event&mdash;even then, now,
      you didn't believe in your innermost heart that I knew what I was talking
      about, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She frowned with impatience as she turned toward him. &ldquo;For heaven's sake,
      Joel,&rdquo; she said, sharply&mdash;&ldquo;you become a bore with that stupid
      nonsense. I want to be patient with you&mdash;I do indeed sympathize with
      you in your misfortunes&mdash;you know that well enough&mdash;but you're
      very tiresome with that eternal harping on what I believed and what I
      didn't believe. Now, are you going to stop to supper or not?&mdash;because
      if you are I must send the maid out. And there's another thing&mdash;would
      it be of any help to you to bring your things here from the hotel? You can
      have Alfred's room as well as not&mdash;till Christmas, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing I couldn't get my luggage out of the hotel till I'd settled my
      bill,&rdquo; suggested Thorpe tentatively, in a muffled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practical woman reflected for an instant. &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; she
      confessed then, &ldquo;that it might be cheaper to leave your things there, and
      buy what little you want&mdash;I don't imagine, from what I've seen, that
      your wardrobe is so very valuable&mdash;but no, I suppose the bill ought
      to be paid. Perhaps it can be managed; how much will it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe musingly rose to his feet, and strolled over to her chair. With his
      thick hands on his sister's shoulders he stooped and kissed her on the
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe in me now, anyway, eh, Lou?&rdquo; he said, as he straightened
      himself behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unaccustomed caress&mdash;so different in character from the
      perfunctory salute with which he had greeted her on his arrival from
      foreign parts, six months before&mdash;brought a flush of pleased surprise
      to her plain face. Then a kind of bewilderment crept into the abstracted
      gaze she was bending upon the fireless grate. Something extraordinary,
      unaccountable, was in the manner of her brother. She recalled that, in
      truth, he was more than half a stranger to her. How could she tell what
      wild, uncanny second nature had not grown up in him under those outlandish
      tropical skies? He had just told her that his ruin was absolute&mdash;overwhelming&mdash;yet
      there had been a covert smile in the recesses of his glance. Even now, she
      half felt, half heard, a chuckle from him, there as he stood behind her!
    </p>
    <p>
      The swift thought that disaster had shaken his brain loomed up and
      possessed her. She flung herself out of the chair, and, wheeling, seized
      its back and drew it between them as she faced him. It was with a stare of
      frank dismay that she beheld him grinning at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rdquo;&mdash;she began, stammering&mdash;&ldquo;What is the matter, Joel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He permitted himself the luxury of smiling blankly at her for a further
      moment. Then he tossed his head, and laughed abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, old girl,&rdquo; he adjured her. &ldquo;Try and hold yourself together, now&mdash;to
      hear some different kind of news. I've been playing it rather low down on
      you, for a fact. Instead of my being smashed, it's the other way about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She continued to confront him, with a nervous clasp upon the chair-back.
      Her breathing troubled her as she regarded him, and tried to take in the
      meaning of his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;you've been lying to me about&mdash;about your
      Company?&rdquo; she asked, confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;not at all,&rdquo; he replied, now all genial heartiness. &ldquo;No&mdash;what
      I told you was gospel truth&mdash;but I was taking a rise out of you all
      the same.&rdquo; He seemed so unaffectedly pleased by his achievement in kindly
      duplicity that she forced an awkward smile to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand in the least,&rdquo; she said, striving to remember what he
      had told her. &ldquo;What you said was that the public had entirely failed to
      come in&mdash;that there weren't enough applications for shares to pay
      flotation expenses&mdash;those were your own words. Of course, I don't
      pretend to understand these City matters&mdash;but it IS the case, isn't
      it, that if people don't subscribe for the shares of a new company, then
      the company is a failure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that may be said to be the case&mdash;as a general rule,&rdquo; he nodded
      at her, still beaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;of course&mdash;I don't understand,&rdquo; she owned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know as you'll understand it much more when I've explained it to
      you,&rdquo; he said, seating himself, and motioning her to the other chair. &ldquo;But
      yes, of course you will. You're a business woman. You know what figures
      mean. And really the whole thing is as simple as A B C. You remember that
      I told you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you going to stop to supper? I must send Annie out before the
      shops close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper? No&mdash;I couldn't eat anything. I'm too worked up for that.
      I'll get something at the hotel before I go to bed, if I feel like it. But
      say!&rdquo;&mdash;the thought suddenly struck him&mdash;&ldquo;if you want to come out
      with me, I'll blow you off to the swaggerest dinner in London. What d'ye
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I shall have some bread and cheese and beer at nine.
      That's my rule, you know. I don't like to break it. I'm always queer next
      day if I do. But now make haste and tell me&mdash;you're really not broken
      then? You have really come out well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer he rose, and drew himself to his full height, and spread his
      bulky shoulders backward. His grey-blue eyes looked down upon her with a
      triumphant glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broken?&rdquo; he echoed her word, with emphasis. &ldquo;My dear Louisa, I'm not the
      sort that gets broken. I break other people. Oh, God, how I shall break
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began pacing up and down on the narrow rug before the fender, excitedly
      telling his story to her. Sometimes he threw the words over his shoulder;
      again he held her absorbed gaze with his. He took his hands often from his
      pockets, to illustrate or enforce by gestures the meaning of his speech&mdash;and
      then she found it peculiarly difficult to realize that he was her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of the narrative, rambling and disconnected, with which he prefaced
      this story of the day, was vaguely familiar to her. He sketched now for
      her in summary, and with the sonorous voice of one deeply impressed with
      the dramatic values of his declamation, the chronicle of his wanderings in
      strange lands&mdash;and these he had frequently told her about before.
      Soon she perceived, however, that he was stringing them together on a new
      thread. One after another, these experiences of his, as he related them,
      turned upon the obstacles and fatal pitfalls which treachery and malice
      had put in his path. He seemed, by his account, to have been a hundred
      times almost within touch of the goal. In China, in the Dutch Indies, in
      those remoter parts of Australia which were a waterless waste when he knew
      them and might have owned them, and now were yielding fabulous millions to
      fellows who had tricked and swindled him&mdash;everywhere he had missed by
      just a hair's breadth the golden consummation. In the Western hemisphere
      the tale repeated itself. There had been times in the Argentine, in Brazil
      just before the Empire fell, in Colorado when the Silver boom was on, in
      British Columbia when the first rumours of rich ore were whispered about&mdash;many
      times when fortune seemed veritably within his grasp. But someone had
      always played him false. There was never a friendship for him which could
      withstand the temptation of profitable treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had hung dauntlessly on. He had seen one concession slipping
      through his fingers, only to strain and tighten them for a clutch at
      another. It did not surprise his hearer&mdash;nor indeed did it
      particularly attract her attention&mdash;that there was nowhere in this
      rapid and comprehensive narrative any allusion to industry of the
      wage-earning sort. Apparently, he had done no work at all, in the
      bread-winner's sense of the word. This was so like Joel that it was taken
      for granted in his sister's mind. All his voyages and adventures and
      painful enterprises had been informed by the desire of the buccaneer&mdash;the
      passion to reap where others had sown, or, at the worst, to get something
      for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discursive story began to narrow and concentrate itself when at last
      it reached Mexico. The sister changed her position in her chair, and
      crossed her knees when Tehuantepec was mentioned. It was from that place
      that Joel had sent her the amazing remittance over two years ago.
      Curiously enough, though, it was at this point in his narrative that he
      now became vague as to details. There were concessions of rubber forests
      mentioned, and the barter of these for other concessions with money to
      boot, and varying phases of a chronic trouble about where the true
      boundary of Guatemala ran&mdash;but she failed clearly to understand much
      about it all. His other schemes and mishaps she had followed readily
      enough. Somehow when they came to Mexico, however, she saw everything
      jumbled and distorted, as through a haze. Once or twice she interrupted
      him to ask questions, but he seemed to attach such slight importance to
      her comprehending these details that she forbore. Only one fact was it
      necessary to grasp about the Mexican episode, apparently. When he quitted
      Tehuantepec, to make his way straight to London, at the beginning of the
      year, he left behind him a rubber plantation which he desired to sell, and
      brought with him between six and seven thousand pounds, with which to pay
      the expenses of selling it. How he had obtained either the plantation or
      the money did not seem to have made itself understood. No doubt, as his
      manner indicated when she ventured her enquiries, it was quite irrelevant
      to the narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Mexico, his experience had been unique, apparently, in that no villain
      had appeared on the scene to frustrate his plans. He at least mentioned no
      one who had wronged him there. When he came to London, however, there were
      villains and to spare. He moved to the mantel, when he arrived at this
      stage of the story, and made clear a space for his elbow to rest among the
      little trinkets and photographs with which it was burdened. He stood still
      thereafter, looking down at her; his voice took on a harsher note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of this story, also, she knew by heart. This strange, bearded,
      greyish-haired brother of hers had come very often during the past
      half-year to the little book-shop, and the widow's home above it, his
      misshapen handbag full of papers, his heart full of rage, hope, grief,
      ambition, disgust, confidence&mdash;everything but despair. It was true,
      it had never been quite real to her. He was right in his suggestion that
      she had never wholly believed in him. She had not been able to take
      altogether seriously this clumsy, careworn, shabbily-dressed man who
      talked about millions. It was true that he had sent her four hundred
      pounds for the education of her son and daughter; it was equally true that
      he had brought with him to London a sum which any of his ancestors, so far
      as she knew about them, would have deemed a fortune, and which he treated
      as merely so much oil, with which to lubricate the machinery of his great
      enterprise. She had heard, at various times, the embittered details of the
      disappearance of this money, little by little. Nearly a quarter of it, all
      told, had been appropriated by a sleek old braggart of a company-promoter,
      who had cozened Joel into the belief that London could be best approached
      through him. When at last this wretch was kicked downstairs, the effect
      had been only to make room for a fresh lot of bloodsuckers. There were
      so-called advertising agents, so-called journalists, so-called &ldquo;men of
      influence in the City,&rdquo;&mdash;a swarm of relentless and voracious harpies,
      who dragged from him in blackmail nearly the half of what he had left,
      before he summoned the courage and decision to shut them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worse still, in some ways, were the men into whose hands he stumbled next&mdash;a
      group of City men concerned in the South African market, who impressed him
      very favourably at the outset. He got to know them by accident, and at the
      time when he began to comprehend the necessity of securing influential
      support for his scheme. Everything that he heard and could learn about
      them testified to the strength of their position in the City. Because they
      displayed a certain amiability of manner toward him and his project, he
      allowed himself to make sure of their support. It grew to be a certainty
      in his mind that they would see him through. He spent a good deal of money
      in dinners and suppers in their honour, after they had let him understand
      that this form of propitiation was not unpleasant to them. They chaffed
      him about some newspaper paragraphs, in which he was described as the
      &ldquo;Rubber King,&rdquo; with an affable assumption of amusement, under which he
      believed that he detected a genuine respect for his abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, when he had danced attendance upon them for the better part of
      two months, he laid before them, at the coffee-and-cigars stage of a
      dinner in a private room of the Savoy, the details of his proposition.
      They were to form a Syndicate to take over his property, and place it upon
      the market; in consideration of their finding the ready money for this
      exploitation, they were to have for themselves two-fifths of the shares in
      the Company ultimately to be floated. They listened to these details, and
      to his enthusiastic remarks about the project itself, with rather
      perfunctory patience, but committed themselves that evening to nothing
      definite. It took him nearly a week thereafter to get an answer from any
      of them. Then he learned that, if they took the matter up at all, it would
      be upon the basis of the Syndicate receiving nine-tenths of the shares.
    </p>
    <p>
      He conceived the idea, after he had mastered his original amazement, that
      they named these preposterous terms merely because they expected to be
      beaten down, and he summoned all his good nature and tact for the task of
      haggling with them. He misunderstood their first show of impatience at
      this, and persevered in the face of their tacit rebuffs. Then, one day, a
      couple of them treated him with overt rudeness, and he, astonished out of
      his caution, replied to them in kind. Suddenly, he could hardly tell why
      or how, they were all enemies of his. They closed their office doors to
      him; even their clerks treated him with contemptuous incivility.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blow to his pride enraged and humiliated him, curiously enough, as no
      other misadventure of his life had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louisa remembered vividly the description he had given to her, at the
      time, of this affair. She had hardly understood why it should disturb him
      so profoundly: to her mind, these men had done nothing so monstrous after
      all. But to him, their offense swallowed up all the other indignities
      suffered during the years of his Ishmaelitish wanderings. A sombre lust
      for vengeance upon them took root in his very soul. He hated nobody else
      as he hated them. How often she had heard him swear, in solemn vibrating
      tones, that to the day of his death his most sacred ambition should be
      their punishment, their abasement in the dust and mire!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, all at once, as she looked up at him, where he leant against the
      mantel, these vagabond memories of hers took point and shape. It was about
      these very men that he was talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And think of it!&rdquo; he was saying, impressively. &ldquo;It's magnificent enough
      for me to make this great hit&mdash;but I don't count it as anything at
      all by comparison with the fact that I make it at their expense. You
      remember the fellows I told you about?&rdquo; he asked abruptly, deferring to
      the confused look on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you make it out of them,&rdquo; she repeated, in an uncertain voice.
      It occurred to her that she must have been almost asleep. &ldquo;But did I miss
      anything? Have you been telling what it is that you have made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;that you shall have in good time. You don't seem to realize it,
      Louisa. I can hardly realize it myself. I am actually a very rich man. I
      can't tell how much I've got&mdash;in fact, it can be almost as much as I
      like&mdash;half a million pounds, I suppose, at the start, if I want to
      make it that much. Yes&mdash;it takes the breath away, doesn't it? But
      best of all&mdash;a thousand times best of all&mdash;practically every
      dollar of it comes out of those Kaffir swine&mdash;the very men that tried
      to rob me, and that have been trying to ruin me ever since. I tell you
      what I wish, Louise&mdash;I wish to God there could only be time enough,
      and I'd take it all in half-sovereigns&mdash;two millions of them, or
      three millions&mdash;and just untwist every coin, one by one, out from
      among their heart-strings. Oh&mdash;but it'll be all right as it is. It's
      enough to make a man feel religious&mdash;to think how those thieves are
      going to suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo; she said, slowly after reflection, &ldquo;it all rather frightens me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if the chill in the air of the cheerless room had suddenly accentuated
      itself, she arose, took a match-box from the mantel, and, stooping, lit
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at the tall, black-clad figure, bent in stiff awkwardness
      over the smoking grate, and his eyes softened. Then he took fresh note of
      the room&mdash;the faded, threadbare carpet, the sparse old furniture that
      had seemed ugly to even his uninformed boyish taste, the dingy walls and
      begrimed low ceiling&mdash;all pathetic symbols of the bleak life to which
      she had been condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frightens you?&rdquo; he queried, with a kind of jovial tenderness, as she got
      to her feet; &ldquo;frightens you, eh? Why, within a month's time, old lady,
      you'll be riding in the Park in your own carriage, with niggers folding
      their arms up behind, and you'll be taking it all as easy and as natural
      as if you'd been born in a barouche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He added, in response to the enquiry of her lifted brows: &ldquo;Barouche?
      That's what we'd call in England a landau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood with a foot upon the fender, her tired, passive face inclined
      meditatively, her rusty old black gown drawn back by one hand from the
      snapping sparks. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, slowly, joyless resignation mingling with
      pride in her voice. &ldquo;I was born here over the shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good God! so was I,&rdquo; he commented, lustily. &ldquo;But that's no reason
      why I shouldn't wind up in Park Lane&mdash;or you either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had nothing to say to this, apparently. After a little, she seated
      herself again, drawing her chair closer to the hearth. &ldquo;It's years since
      I've lit this fire before the first of November,&rdquo; she remarked, with the
      air of defending the action to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we're celebrating,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his hands over the reluctant
      blaze. &ldquo;Everything goes, tonight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face, as she looked up at him, betrayed the bewilderment of her mind.
      &ldquo;You set out to tell me what it was all about,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;You see
      I'm completely in the dark. I only hear you say that you've made a great
      fortune. That's all I know. Or perhaps you've told me as much as you care
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, not at all,&rdquo; he reassured her, pulling his own chair toward him with
      his foot, and sprawling into it with a grunt of relief. &ldquo;If you'll draw me
      a glass of that beer of yours, I'll tell you all about it. It's not a
      thing for everybody to know, not to be breathed to a human being, for that
      matter&mdash;but you'll enjoy it, and it'll be safe enough with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she rose, and moved toward a door, he called merrily after her: &ldquo;No
      more beer when that keg runs dry, you know. Nothing but champagne!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      THORPE took a long, thoughtful pull at the beer his sister brought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I didn't know I was so thirsty,&rdquo; he said, when he put the glass down.
      &ldquo;Truth is&mdash;I've lost track of myself altogether since&mdash;since the
      big thing happened. I seem to be somebody else&mdash;a comparative
      stranger, so to speak. I've got to get acquainted with myself, all over
      again. You can't imagine what an extraordinary feeling it is&mdash;this
      being hit every few minutes with the recollection that you're worth half a
      million. It's like being struck over the head. It knocks you down. There
      are such thousands of things to do&mdash;you dance about, all of a
      flutter. You don't know where to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin where you left off,&rdquo; suggested Louisa. &ldquo;You were going to tell me
      how&mdash;how 'the big thing' happened. You're always coming to it&mdash;and
      never getting any further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nodding comprehension of the rebuke's justification, he plunged forthwith
      into the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember my telling you at the time how I got my Board together. I'm
      speaking now of the present Company&mdash;after I'd decided to be my own
      promoter, and have at least some kind of 'a look-in' for my money. There
      wasn't much money left, by the way; it was considerably under three
      thousand. But I come to that later. First there was the Board. Here was
      where that Lord Plowden that I told you about&mdash;the man that came over
      on the ship with me&mdash;came in. I went to him. I&mdash;God! I was
      desperate&mdash;but I hadn't much of an idea he'd consent. But he did! He
      listened to me, and I told him how I'd been robbed, and how the Syndicate
      would have cut my throat if I hadn't pulled away,&mdash;and he said, 'Why,
      yes, I'll go on your Board.' Then I told him more about it, and presently
      he said he'd get me another man of title&mdash;a sky-scraper of a title
      too&mdash;to be my Chairman. That's the Marquis of Chaldon, a tremendous
      diplomatic swell, you know, Ambassador at Vienna in his time, and Lord
      Lieutenant and all sorts of things, but willing to gather in his five
      hundred a year, all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that YOU pay HIM five hundred pounds a year?&rdquo; asked the
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've got a live Markiss who works for me at ten quid a week, and a
      few extras. The other Directors get three hundred. This Lord Plowden is
      one of them&mdash;but I'll tell you more about him later on. Then there's
      Watkin, he's a small accountant Finsbury way; and Davidson, he's a
      wine-merchant who used to belong to a big firm in Dundee, but gets along
      the best way he can on a very dicky business here in London, now. And then
      there's General Kervick, awfully well-connected old chap, they say, but I
      guess he needs all he can get. He's started wearing his fur-coat already.
      Well, that's my Board. I couldn't join it, of course, till after allotment&mdash;that's
      because I'm the vendor, as they call it&mdash;but that hasn't interfered
      at all with my running the whole show. The Board doesn't really count, you
      know. It only does what I want it to do. It's just a form that costs me
      seventeen hundred a year, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventeen hundred a year,&rdquo; she repeated, mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then we got out the prospectus, d'ye see. Or first, there were
      other things to be done. I saw that a good broker's name counted for a lot
      on a prospectus. I picked out one that I'd heard was reasonable&mdash;it'd
      been a splendid name if I could have got it&mdash;but he calmly said his
      price was two thousand pounds, all cash down&mdash;and I came away.
      Finally I got a fellow who hadn't done much of anything yet, and so wasn't
      so stiff about his figure. He agreed to take 500 pounds cash, and 2,000 in
      shares. It was God's luck that I hit on him, for he turned out, at the
      pinch, to be the one man in a million for me. But I'll tell you about him
      later. He's the Broker, mind; you mustn't forget him. Well, then, he and I
      got a Solicitor&mdash;he took 200 pounds cash, but he had to have 2,000
      shares&mdash;and the firm of Auditors&mdash;they were 100 pounds cash and
      1,000 shares. Every company has to have these people pasted on to it, by
      law. Oh yes, and then you must have your Bankers. You don't pay them
      anything, though, thank God! Well, then, there was the machinery complete,
      all ready to start. I took a handsome set of offices, and furnished them
      up to the nines&mdash;but that I was able to do pretty well on credit. You
      see, ready money was getting short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now came the biggest pull of all. There was the press to be worked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke as if there were no other papers in London but the financial
      journals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't sleep much while that was being fixed up. You've got no more
      idea of what the press means, Louisa, than you have of&mdash;of a coil of
      snakes thawing out hungry in the spring. Why, if one blackmailer came to
      me, I swear a hundred did. They scared the life out of me, the first month
      or so. And then there's a swarm of advertising agents, who say they can
      keep these blackmailers off, if you'll make it worth their while. But they
      all wanted too much money for me&mdash;and for a while I was at my wits'
      ends. At last I got a fellow&mdash;he's not behaved so badly, all things
      considered&mdash;who had some sporting blood in his veins, and he was
      willing to do the whole thing for 5,000 pounds, if I could pay 1,500
      pounds down, and the rest in shares. But that was just what I couldn't do,
      you see, so finally he took 1,000 pounds down and 5,000 in shares&mdash;and
      as I say he's done it tolerably well. There was one editor that I had to
      square personally&mdash;that is to say, 100 pounds cash&mdash;it had to be
      in sovereigns, for notes could be traced&mdash;and a call of 2,000 shares
      at par,&mdash;he's the boss pirate that everybody has to square&mdash;and
      of course there were odd ten-pound notes here and there, but as a rule I
      just opened the door and fired the black-mailers out. The moment a fellow
      came in, and handed me his card, and said he had proofs of two kinds of
      articles in his pocket, one praising me, one damning me, I told him to go
      and see my advertising agent, and if he wouldn't do that, then to go to
      hell. That's the way you've got to talk in the City,&rdquo; he added, as if in
      apologetic explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louisa looked impassively at her brother. &ldquo;Oh, I've heard the expression
      as far west as the Strand,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then came the issue. That was last Saturday. You saw the prospectus
      in Saturday morning's papers, and in the weeklies. The list was to be kept
      open, it said, till Wednesday morning&mdash;that was yesterday. That is to
      say, during all that time, people could apply for shares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which they didn't do&mdash;according to your account,&rdquo; the sister
      suggested, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe passed his fingers through his roughened hair, and eyed her with a
      momentary quizzical gleam in his eye. Then he became serious again. The
      recollection of what he was now to narrate brought a frown to his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Tuesday afternoon,&rdquo; he began, with portentous deliberation&mdash;&ldquo;Or
      no, first I must explain something. You see, in bringing out a company,
      you can't put up too stout a bluff. I mean, you've got to behave as if you
      were rolling in wealth&mdash;as if everything was coming your way, and
      fortunes were to be made by fastening to you. I don't know that it often
      fools anybody very much, but it's part of the game, and you must play it.
      Well, accordingly, my Broker goes on 'change Saturday morning, and has his
      jobber shout out that he'll buy 'Rubber Consols'&mdash;that's what our
      shares are called on the street&mdash;at an eighth premium; that is to
      say, he offered to buy for twenty-two-and-six what we were offering to the
      public for twenty shillings. Of course, you see, the object of that was to
      create the impression that there was a regular God-almighty rush for our
      shares. As I say, I don't know whether that ever fooled anybody&mdash;but
      at least there was the chance that it might start up some dealing in the
      shares&mdash;and all those things help. Besides, you got the sales noticed
      in the papers, and that might start up applications from the public. Well,
      the Broker bought 1,000 shares this way on Saturday. On Monday, when it
      might still be possible to change the luck, he bought 3,500 more, still at
      that premium of an eighth. He bought some Tuesday morning too&mdash;say
      4,000. Well, now, keep those figures in your head, and keep an eye on the
      Broker. He's worth watching&mdash;as you'll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's his name?&rdquo; asked the sister, with an accession of alertness in her
      face. &ldquo;You call him 'Broker'&mdash;and that doesn't mean anything to me.
      They're all brokers, aren't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Semple&mdash;Colin Semple, that's his name. He's a young Scotchman&mdash;father's
      a Presbyterian minister. He's a little, insignificant runt of a chap to
      look at&mdash;but I learned a long time ago not to judge a singed cat by
      his looks. However&mdash;where was I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were going to tell about Tuesday afternoon, weren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded gravely, and straightened himself, drawing a long breath in
      preparation for the dramatic recital before him. &ldquo;On Tuesday afternoon,&rdquo;
       he began again, with impressive slowness, &ldquo;I was walking on Throgmorton
      Street, about four o'clock. It was raining a little&mdash;it had been
      raining on and off all day&mdash;a miserable, rotten sort of a day, with
      greasy mud everywhere, and everybody poking umbrellas into you. I was out
      walking because I'd 'a' cut my throat if I'd tried to stay in the office
      another ten minutes. All that day I hadn't eaten anything. I hadn't slept
      worth speaking of for three nights. The whole game was up for me. I was
      worse than ruined. I had half a crown in my pocket. I had ten or twelve
      pounds in the bank&mdash;and they wouldn't let me overdraw a farthing. I
      tell you, I was just plumb busted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There came along in the gutter a sandwich-man. I'd seen the cuss before
      during the day, walking up and down near my offices. I took notice of him,
      because he was the raggedest, dirtiest, most forlorn-looking cripple you
      ever saw in your life. Now I read what was on his boards. It was the bill
      of a paper that I had refused to be bled by, and there it was in big
      letters: 'The Rubber Bubble Burst!' 'Thorpe's Audacity Punished!' Those
      were the words. I can see them with my eyes shut. I stood there, looking
      at the fellow, and I suppose there was something in the way I looked, for
      he stopped too. Of course, he didn't know me from Adam, but all the same,
      I'm damned if he didn't wink his eye at me&mdash;as if we two had a joke
      between us. And at that I burst out laughing&mdash;I simply roared with
      laughter, like a boy at a pantomime&mdash;and I took that last half-crown
      out of my pocket, and I gave it to the sandwich-man. God! you should have
      seen his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't particularly mind, Joel,&rdquo; said his sister, &ldquo;but I never heard you
      swear so much before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what the&mdash;what the deuce!&rdquo; he protested, impatiently. &ldquo;Don't
      interrupt me now! Well, I went on down the street. The members of the
      Stock Exchange were coming out of 'the house,' and making up little groups
      on the pavement. They do business inside, you know, until closing time&mdash;this
      day it happened to be four o'clock&mdash;and then they come out and deal
      in the street with one another, with the kerb-stone mob, who are not
      allowed inside, standing round to watch the thing. I came along into the
      thick of these fellows; they were yelling out all sorts of things&mdash;'East
      Rands,' 'Oroyas,' 'Lake View Centrals,' and what not, but these went in
      one ear and out the other. If there ever was a man with no stomach for the
      market it was me. But then someone roared out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'At seven-eighths, sell Rubber Consols! Sell five hundred Rubber at
      seven-eighths! Sell five hundred at three-quarters! At three-quarters you
      have 'em! Rubber Consols! Sell a thou. at three-quarters!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This thing went into my brain like a live coal. I stopped and looked up
      at the fellow&mdash;and by God, it was one of the men I've been talking
      about&mdash;one of those Kaffir scoundrels. I wish I was better at
      remembering names&mdash;but I knew his face. There were some of the others
      around him, and they laughed at me, and he laughed at me. Oh, they had a
      heap of fun out of me&mdash;for a minute or two. Pretty good fun, too! I
      guess they'll remember it quite a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; Louisa adjured him. The obvious proximity of the dramatic climax
      drew her forward in her chair, and brought a glow of expectation to her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got myself away from that crowd somehow&mdash;I think I was afraid if I
      stayed I'd strangle the one who was shouting on the steps&mdash;and I went
      toward my office. But when I got to the door, I didn't have the courage to
      go in. I'd furnished it better, I suppose, than any other office in Austin
      Friars, and I had a kind of feeling that the sight of those carpets, and
      oak-tables and desks, and brass-railings and so on would make me sick. I
      owed for 'em all, bear in mind&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;Joel,&rdquo; the sister interposed. &ldquo;One thing I don't understand.
      How many people had applied for shares? You haven't mentioned that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fleeting smile lighted up the saturnine gloom of his present mood. &ldquo;It
      was hardly worth mentioning,&rdquo; he answered, with bitter mirth. &ldquo;Between
      five and six thousand shares were subscribed, all told. I think the
      withdrawals by telegraph brought it down to practically five thousand. We
      offered a hundred thousand, you know.&mdash;But let me go on with my
      story. I stood there, in front of our street-door, in a kind of trance.
      The words of that Jew&mdash;'Sell Rubber Consols at three-quarters!'&mdash;buzzed
      inside my head as if they would burst it open. I turned&mdash;and I
      happened to see my Broker&mdash;the Scotchman, Semple, you know&mdash;coming
      along toward me. Right at that minute, like a flash, something dawned on
      me. In less than a second, I saw the whole damned rotten outfit turned
      upside down, with me on top. I made a jump, and ran to meet Semple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How many shares of ours have you bought?' I asked him, with a grip tight
      on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little chap was looking mighty sick. He figured up in his mind. 'I'm
      afraid it's eight thousand five hundred, all told,' he said, in a sort of
      Presbyterian whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well&mdash;how would these gentlemen go about it to deliver their goods&mdash;that
      is, supposing we got a settlement?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked him this, and kept my eye on his face. He looked puzzled for a
      minute. Then he put out his lip. Then he shot me a glance as sharp as a
      razor, and we looked into one another's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'They were shouting them out to me at three-quarters, a minute ago,' I
      told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was onto the game like lightning. 'Wait for me in the office,' he
      whispered. 'We'll go nap on this!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that he was off like a streak. He stopped running just before he got
      to the corner, though, and began walking slowly, sauntering along, you
      know, as if his mind was on nothing but second-hand books. I watched him
      out of sight&mdash;and then I went back, and up to the offices. The
      furniture didn't scare me a bit this time. Why, I stopped and felt of the
      brass-railing just outside the Board Room, and I said to myself&mdash;'Pshaw!
      We could have you of solid gold, if we wanted to.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused here, and regarded his sister with what she felt was intended to
      be a significant look. She shrank from the confession that its meaning was
      Greek to her. &ldquo;Well&mdash;and what next?&rdquo; she asked, guardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Semple came back in twenty minutes or so&mdash;and the next morning he
      was at it again&mdash;and what with him and his jobber, by George, on the
      quiet, they picked up nearly eighteen thousand of our shares. Some they
      paid fifteen shillings for, some they got at twelve-and-six and even ten.
      That doesn't matter; it's of no more importance than the coppers you give
      to crossing-sweepers. The thing was to get the shares&mdash;and by God
      we've got them! Twenty-six thousand two hundred shares, that's what we've
      got. Now, do you see what that means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes,&rdquo; she answered, with a faint-hearted assumption of confidence.
      &ldquo;Of course, you know the property is so good that you'll make a profit on
      the shares you've bought far below their value. But I don't think I quite
      see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted her with an outburst of loud laughter. &ldquo;Don't think you
      quite see?&rdquo; he gurgled at her, with tears of pleasure in his eye. &ldquo;Why,
      you dummy, you haven't got the faintest glimmer of a notion of what it's
      all about. The value of the property's got nothing in the world to do with
      it. That's neither here nor there. If there wasn't any such property in
      existence, it would be just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had compassion upon her blank countenance, at this, and explained more
      gently: &ldquo;Why, don't you see, Lou, it's this way. This is what has
      happened. We've got what's called a corner on the bears. They're caught
      short, and we can squeeze them to our hearts' content. What&mdash;you
      don't understand now? Why, see here! These fellows who've sold twenty-six
      thousand of our shares&mdash;they haven't got them to sell, and they can't
      get them. That is the point&mdash;they can't get them for love nor money&mdash;they
      must pay me my own price for them, or be ruined men. The moment they
      realize the situation, they will begin offering a premium for Rubber
      Consols. The price of a one-pound share will be two pounds, then four&mdash;six&mdash;ten&mdash;twenty&mdash;thirty&mdash;whatever
      I want to drive it to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louisa stared up at him with wide open eyes. It seemed to her that she
      understood now. It was very exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on, taking approving note of the new light of
      comprehension in her glance, &ldquo;we did something that Tuesday afternoon
      beside buy up these shares. Semple rushed off to his office, and he and
      his clerks got up a lot of dummy applications for shares, made out in all
      the different names they could be safe in using, and they put these into
      the bank with the application money&mdash;Semple found that&mdash;and next
      day he went and saw the advertising agent and the solicitor and the
      auditors&mdash;and got them to pool the shares that I've promised to give
      them. A pool? That means they agree to transfer their shares to me as
      trustee, and let me deal with them as I like&mdash;of course to their
      advantage. In any case, their shares are vendor's shares, and couldn't be
      dealt with in this transaction. So you see the thing is hermetically
      sealed. Nobody can get a share except from me, and at my price. But these
      fellows that have sold them&mdash;they've got to have them, don't you see.
      They had their little temporary joke with me on the street that afternoon&mdash;and
      now they must walk up to the captain's office and settle. They've got to
      pay me at least half a million pounds for that few minutes' fun of theirs.
      I may make it a good deal more; I don't know yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Joel!&rdquo; she groaned at him, in awed stupefaction. His rather languid
      indecision as to whether half a million was going to be enough, impressed
      her more powerfully than had any detail of his narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few comprehensive sentences he finished up for her what there was to
      tell. &ldquo;This afternoon my Board met to allot the shares. They saw the
      applications, amounting in all to over ninety thousand shares. It took
      their breath away&mdash;they had heard that things were going quite the
      other way with us. They were so tickled that they asked no questions The
      allotment went through like a greased pig. About 5,000 shares went to
      those who had actually applied for them, and 88,000 were solemnly given to
      the dummy applicants. Of course, there wasn't a whisper about these
      dummies. Nobody winked so much as an eyelash. But I've found since that
      one of the directors&mdash;that Lord Plowden I told you about&mdash;was
      onto the thing all the while. But he's all right. Everybody's all right.
      Of course the dummies' shares still stand in their names&mdash;on paper&mdash;but
      in reality I've got them all in my safe&mdash;in my pocket you might say.
      They are really mine, you understand. So now there's nothing for us to do
      but to apply to the Stock Exchange for a special settlement date, and
      meanwhile lie quiet and watch the Jews stew in their own juice. Or fry in
      their own fat, eh? That's better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she commented slowly, &ldquo;you say there are no shares to be bought&mdash;and
      yet as I understand it, there are those five thousand that were sent out
      to the people who really applied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Lou!&rdquo; he answered her jovially. &ldquo;You actually do understand the
      thing. You've put your finger straight on the point. It is true that those
      shares are out against us&mdash;or might be turned against us if they
      could be bought up. But in reality, they don't count at all. In the first
      place, you see, they're scattered about among small holders, country
      clergymen and old maids on an annuity and so on&mdash;all over the
      country. Even if these people were all traced, and hunted up, suppose it
      was worth the trouble and expense, they wouldn't sell. The bigger the
      price they were offered, the more mulish they would be about holding.
      That's always the way with them. But even if they did all sell, their five
      thousand would be a mere drop in the bucket. There would be over twenty
      thousand others to be accounted for. That would be quite enough for my
      purposes. Oh, I figured all that out very carefully. My own first notion
      was to have the dummies apply for the whole hundred thousand, and even a
      little over. Then, you see, we might have allotted everything to the
      dummies, and sent back the money and applications of the genuine ones. But
      that would have been rather hard to manage with the Board. The Markiss
      would have said that the returns ought to be made pro rata&mdash;that is,
      giving everybody a part of what they applied for&mdash;and that would have
      mixed everything up. And then, too, if anybody suspected anything, why the
      Stock Exchange Committee would refuse us a special settlement&mdash;and,
      of course, without that the whole transaction is moonshine. It was far too
      risky, and we didn't send back a penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all pretty risky, I should think,&rdquo; she declared as she rose. &ldquo;I
      should think you'd lie awake more than ever now&mdash;now that you've
      built your hopes so high and it'd be so awful to have them come to
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smilingly shook his head. &ldquo;No, it can no more fail than that gas can
      fail to burn when you put a light to it. It's all absolute. My
      half-million is as right as if it were lying to my credit in the Bank of
      England. Oh, that reminds me,&rdquo; he went on in a slightly altered tone&mdash;&ldquo;it's
      damned comical, but I've got to ask you for a little money. I've only got
      about seven pounds at my bank, and just at the minute it would give me
      away fearfully to let Semple know I was hard up. Of course he'd let me
      have anything I wanted&mdash;but, you can see&mdash;I don't like to ask
      him just at the moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated visibly, and scanned his face with a wistful gaze. &ldquo;You're
      quite sure, Joel?&rdquo;&mdash;she began&mdash;&ldquo;and you haven't told me&mdash;how
      long will it be before you come into some of this money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;&mdash;he in turn paused over his words&mdash;&ldquo;well, I suppose that
      by next week things will be in such shape that my bank will see I'm good
      for an overdraft. Oh heavens, yes! there'll be a hundred ways of touching
      some ready. But if you've got twenty or thirty pounds handy just now&mdash;I
      tell you what I'll do, Lou. I'll give you a three months bill, paying one
      hundred pounds for every sovereign you let me have now. Come, old lady:
      you don't get such interest every day, I'll bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want any interest from you, Joel,&rdquo; she replied, simply. &ldquo;If
      you're sure I can have it back before Christmas, I think I can manage
      thirty pounds. It will do in the morning, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded an amused affirmative. &ldquo;Why&mdash;you don't imagine, do you,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;that all this gold is to rain down, and none of it hit you?
      Interest? Why of course you'll get interest&mdash;and capital thrown in.
      What did you suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't ask anything for myself,&rdquo; she made answer, with a note of
      resolution in her voice. &ldquo;Of course if you like to do things for the
      children, it won't be me who'll stand in their light. They've been spoiled
      for my kind of life as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do things for everybody,&rdquo; he affirmed roundly. &ldquo;Let's see&mdash;how
      old is Alfred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll be twenty in May&mdash;and Julia is fourteen months older than he
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; was Thorpe's meditative comment. &ldquo;How they shoot up! Why I was
      thinking she was a little girl.&rdquo; &ldquo;She never will be tall, I'm afraid,&rdquo;
       said the literal mother. &ldquo;She favours her father's family. But Alfred is
      more of a Thorpe. I'm sorry you missed seeing them last summer&mdash;but
      of course they didn't stop long with me. This was no place for them&mdash;and
      they had a good many invitations to visit schoolfellows and friends in the
      country. Alfred reminds me very much of what you were at his age: he's got
      the same good opinion of himself, too&mdash;and he's not a bit fonder of
      hard work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one mighty big difference between us, though,&rdquo; remarked Thorpe.
      &ldquo;He won't start with his nose held down to the grindstone by an old father
      hard as nails. He'll start like a gentleman&mdash;the nephew of a rich
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm almost afraid to have such notions put in his head,&rdquo; she replied,
      with visible apprehension. &ldquo;You mustn't encourage him to build too high
      hopes, Joel. It's speculation, you know&mdash;and anything might happen to
      you. And then&mdash;you may marry, and have sons of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his brows swiftly&mdash;as if the thought were new to his mind.
      A slow smile stole into the little wrinkles about his eyes. He opened his
      lips as if to speak, and then closed them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at last, abruptly straightening himself, and casting an
      eye about for his coat and hat. &ldquo;I'll be round in the morning&mdash;on my
      way to the City. Good-bye till then.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN Charing Cross station, the next afternoon, Mr. Thorpe discovered by the
      big clock overhead that he had arrived fully ten minutes too soon. This
      deviation from his deeply-rooted habit of catching trains at the last
      possible moment did not take him by surprise. He smiled dryly, aud nodded
      to the illuminated dial, as if they shared the secret of some quaint
      novelty. This getting to the station ahead of time was of a piece with
      what had been happening all day&mdash;merely one more token of the general
      upheaval in the routine of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      From early morning he had been acutely conscious of the feeling that his
      old manners and usages and methods of thought&mdash;the thousand familiar
      things that made up the Thorpe he had been&mdash;were becoming strange to
      him. They fitted him no longer; they began to fall away from him. Now, as
      he stood here on the bustling platform, it was as if they had all
      disappeared&mdash;been left somewhere behind him outside the station. With
      the two large bags which the porter was looking after&mdash;both of a
      quite disconcerting freshness of aspect&mdash;and the new overcoat and
      shining hat, he seemed to himself a new kind of being, embarked upon a
      voyage of discovery in the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even his face was new. A sudden and irresistible impulse had led him to
      the barber-shop in his hotel at the outset; he could not wait till after
      breakfast to have his beard removed. The result, when he beheld it in the
      mirror, had not been altogether reassuring. The over-long, thin, tawny
      moustasche which survived the razor assumed an undue prominence; the jaw
      and chin, revealed now for the first time in perhaps a dozen years, seemed
      of a sickly colour, and, in some inexplicable way, misshapen. Many times
      during the day, at his office, at the restaurant where he lunched, at
      various outfitters' shops which he had visited, he had pursued the task of
      getting reconciled to this novel visage in the looking-glass. The little
      mirrors in the hansom cabs had helped him most in this endeavour. Each
      returned to him an image so different from all the others&mdash;some
      cadaverous, some bloated, but each with a spontaneous distortion of its
      own&mdash;that it had become possible for him to strike an average
      tolerable to himself, and to believe in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister had recognized him upon the instant, when he entered the old
      book-shop to get the money promised overnight, but in the City his own
      clerks had not known him at first. There was in this an inspiring
      implication that he had not so much changed his appearance as revived his
      youth. The consciousness that he was in reality still a young man spread
      over his mind afresh, and this time he felt that it was effacing all
      earlier impressions. Why, when he thought of it, the delight he had had
      during the day in buying new shirts and handkerchiefs and embroidered
      braces, in looking over the various stocks of razors, toilet articles,
      studs and sleeve-links, and the like, and telling the gratified tradesmen
      to give him the best of everything&mdash;this delight had been
      distinctively boyish. He doubted, indeed, if any mere youth could have
      risen to the heights of tender satisfaction from which he reflected upon
      the contents of his portmanteaus. To apprehend their full value one must
      have been without them for such a weary time! He had this wonderful
      advantage&mdash;that he supplemented the fresh-hearted joy of the youth in
      nice things, with the adult man's knowledge of how bald existence could be
      without them. It was worth having lived all those forty obscure and mostly
      unpleasant years, for this one privilege now of being able to appreciate
      to the uttermost the touch of double-silk underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an undoubted pity that there had not been time to go to a good
      tailor. The suit he had on was right enough for ordinary purposes, and his
      evening-clothes were as good as new, but the thought of a costume for
      shooting harassed his mind. He had brought along with him, for this
      eventful visit, an old Mexican outfit of yellowish-grey cloth and leather,
      much the worse for rough wear, but saved from the disreputable by its
      suggestion of picturesque experiences in a strange and romantic country.
      At least it had seemed to him, in the morning, when he had packed it, to
      be secure in this salvation. Uneasy doubts on the subject had soon risen,
      however, and they had increased in volume and poignancy as his conceptions
      of a wardrobe expanded in the course of the day's investigations and
      purchases. He had reached the point now of hoping that it would rain
      bitterly on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was doubly important to keep a close look-out for Lord Plowden, since
      he did not know the name of the station they were to book for, and time
      was getting short. He dwelt with some annoyance upon his oversight in this
      matter, as his watchful glance ranged from one entrance to another. He
      would have liked to buy the tickets himself, and have everything in
      readiness on the arrival of his host. As it was, he could not even tell
      the porter how his luggage was to be labelled, and there was now less than
      two minutes! He moved forward briskly, with the thought of intercepting
      his friend at the front of the station; then halted, and went back, upon
      the recollection that while he was going out one way, Plowden might come
      in by the other. The seconds, as they passed now, became severally painful
      to his nerves. The ringing of a bell somewhere beyond the barrier provoked
      within him an impulse to tearful profanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly everything was all right. A smooth-faced, civilly-spoken
      young man came up, touched his hat, and asked: &ldquo;Will you kindly show me
      which is your luggage, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe, even while wondering what business of his it was, indicated the
      glaringly new bags&mdash;and then only half repressed a cry of pleasure at
      discovering that Lord Plowden stood beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right; my man will look out for your things,&rdquo; said the latter,
      as they shook hands. &ldquo;We will go and get our places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fat policeman at the gate touched his helmet. A lean, elderly man in a
      sort of guard's uniform hobbled obsequiously before them down the
      platform, opened to them a first-class compartment with a low bow and a
      deprecatory wave of the hand, and then impressively locked the door upon
      them. &ldquo;The engine will be the other way, my Lord, after you leave Cannon
      Street,&rdquo; he remarked through the open window, with earnest deference. &ldquo;Are
      there any of your bags that you want in the compartment with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plowden had nodded to the first remark. He shook his head at the second.
      The elderly man at this, with still another bow, flapped out a green flag
      which he had been holding furled behind his back, and extended it at arm's
      length. The train began slowly to move. Mr. Thorpe reflected to himself
      that the peerage was by no means so played-out an institution as some
      people imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho-ho!&rdquo; the younger man sighed a yawn, as he tossed his hat into the rack
      above his head. &ldquo;We shall both be the better for some pure air. London
      quite does me up. And you&mdash;you've been sticking at it months on end,
      haven't you? You look rather fagged&mdash;or at all events you did
      yesterday. You've smartened yourself so&mdash;without your beard&mdash;that
      I can't say I'd notice it to-day. But I take it every sensible person is
      glad to get away from London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except for an odd Sunday, now and then, I haven't put my nose outside
      London since I landed here.&rdquo; Thorpe rose as he spoke, to deposit his hat
      also in the rack. He noted with a kind of chagrin that his companion's was
      an ordinary low black bowler. &ldquo;I can tell you, I SHALL be glad of the
      change. I would have bought the tickets,&rdquo; he went on, giving words at
      random to the thought which he found fixed on the surface of his mind, &ldquo;if
      I'd only known what our station was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plowden waved his hand, and the gesture seemed to dismiss the subject. He
      took a cigar case from his pocket, and offered it to Thorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was lucky, my not missing the train altogether,&rdquo; he said, as they
      lighted their cigars. &ldquo;I was up late last night&mdash;turned out late this
      morning, been late all day, somehow&mdash;couldn't catch up with the clock
      for the life of me. Your statement to me last night&mdash;you know it
      rather upset me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled. &ldquo;Well, I guess I know something about that feeling
      myself. Why, I've been buzzing about today like a hen with her head cut
      off. But it's fun, though, aint it, eh? Just to happen to remember every
      once in a while, you know, that it's all true! But of course it means a
      thousand times more to me than it does to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The train had come to a stop inside the gloomy, domed cavern of Cannon
      Street. Many men in silk hats crowded to and fro on the platform, and a
      number of them shook the handle of the locked door. There was an effect of
      curses in the sound of their remarks which came through the closed window.
      Mr. Thorpe could not quite restrain the impulse to grin at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that's where you mistake,&rdquo; said Plowden, contemplating the mouthful
      of smoke he slowly blew forth. &ldquo;My dear man, you can't imagine anybody to
      whom it would mean more than it does to me&mdash;I hope none of those
      fellows have a key. They're an awful bore on this train. I almost never go
      by it, for that reason. Ah, thank God we're off!&mdash;But as I was
      saying, this thing makes a greater difference to me than you can think of.
      I couldn't sleep last night&mdash;I give you my word&mdash;the thing upset
      me so. I take it you&mdash;you have never had much money before; that is,
      you know from experience what poverty is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe nodded with eloquent gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;but you&rdquo;&mdash;the other began, and then paused. &ldquo;What I mean
      is,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;you were never, at any rate, responsible to anybody but
      yourself. If you had only a sovereign a day, or a sovereign a week, for
      that matter, you could accommodate yourself to the requirements of the
      situation. I don't mean that you would enjoy it any more than I should&mdash;but
      at least it was open to you to do it, without attracting much attention.
      But with me placed in my ridiculous position&mdash;poverty has been the
      most unbearable torture one can imagine. You see, there is no way in which
      I can earn a penny. I had to leave the Army when I was twenty-three&mdash;the
      other fellows all had plenty of money to spend, and it was impossible for
      me to drag along with a title and an empty pocket. I daresay that I ought
      to have stuck to it, because it isn't nearly so bad now, but twelve years
      ago it was too cruel for any youngster who had any pride about him&mdash;and,
      of course, my father having made rather a name in the Army, that made it
      so much harder for me. And after that, what was there? Of course, the bar
      and medicine and engineering and those things were out of the question, in
      those days at least. The Church?&mdash;that was more so still. I had a try
      at politics&mdash;but you need money there as much as anywhere else&mdash;money
      or big family connections. I voted in practically every division for four
      years, and I made the rottenest speeches you ever heard of at Primrose
      League meetings in small places, and after all that the best thing the
      whips could offer me was a billet in India at four hundred a year, and
      even that you took in depreciated rupees. When I tried to talk about
      something at home, they practically laughed in my face. I had no leverage
      upon them whatever. They didn't care in the least whether I came up and
      voted or stopped at home. Their majority was ten to one just the same&mdash;yes,
      twenty to one. So that door was shut in my face. I've never been inside
      the House since&mdash;except once to show it to an American lady last
      summer&mdash;but when I do go again I rather fancy&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped for
      an instant, and nodded his handsome head significantly&mdash;&ldquo;I rather
      fancy I shall turn up on the other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a Liberal myself, in English politics,&rdquo; interposed Thorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plowden seemed not to perceive the connection. They had left London Bridge
      behind, and he put his feet up on the cushions, and leant back
      comfortably. &ldquo;Of course there was the City,&rdquo; he went on, speaking
      diagonally across to his companion, between leisurely intervals of
      absorption in his cigar. &ldquo;There have been some directors' fees, no doubt,
      and once or twice I've come very near to what promised to be a big thing&mdash;but
      I never quite pulled it off. Really, without capital what can one do?&mdash;I'm
      curious to know&mdash;did you bring much ready money with you to England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between six and seven thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it's a fair question&mdash;how much of it have you got left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had some momentary doubts as to whether this was a fair question,
      but he smothered them under the smile with which he felt impelled to
      answer the twinkle in Plowden's eyes. &ldquo;Oh, less than a hundred,&rdquo; he said,
      and laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plowden also laughed. &ldquo;By George, that's fine!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It's splendid.
      There's drama in it. I felt it was like that, you know. Something told me
      it was your last cartridge that rang the bell. It was that that made me
      come to you as I did&mdash;and tell you that you were a great man, and
      that I wanted to enlist under you. Ah, that kind of courage is so rare!
      When a man has it, he can stand the world on its head.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I was plumb
      scared, all the while, myself,&rdquo; Thorpe protested, genially. &ldquo;Courage? I
      could feel it running out of my boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, but that's the great thing,&rdquo; insisted the other. &ldquo;You didn't
      look as if you were frightened. From all one could see, your nerve was
      sublime. And nothing else matters&mdash;it was sublime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious&mdash;that thing happened to me once before,&rdquo; commented Thorpe,
      with ruminating slowness. &ldquo;It was out on the plains, years ago, and I was
      in pretty hard luck, and was making my way alone from Tucson north, and
      some cowboys held me up, and were going to make kindling wood of me, they
      being under the impression that I was a horse-thief they were looking
      after. There was five or six minutes there when my life wasn't worth a
      last year's bird's-nest&mdash;and I tell you, sir, I was the scaredest man
      that ever drew the breath of life. And then something happened to be said
      that put the matter right&mdash;they saw I was the wrong man&mdash;and
      then&mdash;why then they couldn't be polite enough to me. They half
      emptied their flasks down my throat, and they rode with me all the way to
      the next town, and there they wanted to buy everything liquid in the place
      for me. But what I was speaking of&mdash;do you know, those fellows got a
      tremendous notion of my nerve. It wasn't so much that they told me so, but
      they told others about it. They really thought I was game to the core&mdash;when
      in reality, as I tell you, I was in the deadliest funk you ever heard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just it,&rdquo; said Plowden, &ldquo;the part of you which was engaged in
      making mental notes of the occasion thought you were frightened; we will
      say that it was itself frightened. But the other part of you, the part
      that was transacting business, so to speak&mdash;that wasn't in the least
      alarmed. I fancy all born commanders are built like that. Did you ever see
      General Grant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What reminded me of him&mdash;there is an account in his Memoirs of how
      he felt when he first was given a command, at the beginning of the Civil
      War. He was looking about for the enemy, who was known to be in the
      vicinity, and the nearer he got to where this enemy probably was, the more
      he got timid and unnerved, he says, until it seemed as if cowardice were
      getting complete mastery of him. And then suddenly it occurred to him that
      very likely the enemy was just as afraid of him as he was of the enemy,
      and that moment his bravery all returned to him. He went in and gave the
      other man a terrible thrashing. It doesn't apply to your case,
      particularly&mdash;but I fancy that all really brave men have those inner
      convictions of weakness, even while they are behaving like lions. Those
      must have been extraordinarily interesting experiences of yours&mdash;on
      the plains. I wish I could have seen something of that part of America
      when I was there last year. Unfortunately, it didn't come my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I remembered your saying you'd been West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plowden smiled. &ldquo;I'm afraid I did think it was West at the time. But since
      my return I've been warned that I mustn't call Chicago West. That was as
      far as I went. I had some business there, or thought I had. When my father
      died, that was in 1884, we found among his papers a lot of bonds of some
      corporation purporting to be chartered by the State of Illinois. Our
      solicitors wrote several letters, but they could find out nothing about
      them, and there the matter rested. Finally, last year, when I decided to
      make the trip, I recollected these old bonds, and took them with me. I
      thought they might at least pay my expenses. But it wasn't the least good.
      Nobody knew anything about them. It seems they related to something that
      was burned up in the Great Fire&mdash;either that, or had disappeared
      before that time. That fire seems to have operated like the Deluge&mdash;it
      cancelled everything that had happened previously. My unhappy father had a
      genius for that kind of investment. I shall have great pleasure in showing
      you tomorrow, a very picturesque and comprehensive collection of
      Confederate Bonds. Their face value is, as I remember it, eighty thousand
      dollars&mdash;that is, sixteen thousand pounds. I would entertain with joy
      an offer of sixteen shillings for the lot. My dear father bought them&mdash;I
      should not be surprised to learn that he bought them at a premium. If they
      ever touched a premium for a day, that is certainly the day that he would
      have hit upon to buy. Oh, it was too rare! Too inspired! He left nearly a
      hundred thousand pounds' worth of paper&mdash;that is, on its face&mdash;upon
      which the solicitors realized, I think it was thirteen hundred pounds.
      It's hard to imagine how he got them&mdash;but there were actually bonds
      among them issued by Kossuth's Hungarian Republic in 1848. Well&mdash;now
      you can see the kind of inheritance I came into, and I have a brother and
      sister more or less to look after, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had been listening to these details with an almost exaggerated
      expression of sympathy upon his face. The voice in which he spoke now
      betrayed, however, a certain note of incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see that well enough,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;But what I don't perhaps
      quite understand&mdash;well, this is it. You have this place of yours in
      the country, and preserve game and so on&mdash;but of course I see what
      you mean. It's what you've been saying. What another man would think a
      comfortable living, is poverty to a man in your position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the place,&rdquo; said Plowden. &ldquo;It isn't mine at all. I could never have
      kept it up. It belongs to my mother. It was her father's place; it has
      been in their family for hundreds of years. Her father, I daresay you
      know, was the last Earl of Hever. The title died with him. He left three
      daughters, who inherited his estates, and my mother, being the eldest, got
      the Kentish properties. Of course Hadlow House will come to me eventually,
      but it is hers during her lifetime. I may speak of it as my place, but
      that is merely a facon de parler; it isn't necessary to explain to
      everybody that it's my mother's. It's my home, and that's enough. It's a
      dear old place. I can't tell you how glad I am that you're going to see
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very glad, too,&rdquo; said the other, with unaffected sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the ambitions I have in the world,&rdquo; the nobleman went on, sitting
      upright now, and speaking with a confidential seriousness, &ldquo;centre round
      Hadlow. That is the part of me that I'm keen about. The Plowdens are
      things of yesterday. My grandfather, the Chancellor, began in a very small
      way, and was never anything more than a clever lawyer, with a loud voice
      and a hard heart, and a talent for money-making and politics. He got a
      peerage and he left a fortune. My father, for all he was a soldier, had a
      mild voice and a soft heart. He gave a certain military distinction to the
      peerage, but he played hell-and-tommy with the fortune. And then I come: I
      can't be either a Chancellor or a General, and I haven't a penny to bless
      myself with. You can't think of a more idiotic box for a man to be in. But
      now&mdash;thanks to you&mdash;there comes this prospect of an immense
      change. If I have money at my back&mdash;at once everything is different
      with me. People will remember then promptly enough that I am a Hadlow, as
      well as a Plowden. I will make the party whips remember it, too. It won't
      be a Secretary's billet in India at four hundred a year that they'll offer
      me, but a Governorship at six thousand&mdash;that is, if I wish to leave
      England at all. And we'll see which set of whips are to have the honour of
      offering me anything. But all that is in the air. It's enough, for the
      moment, to realize that things have really come my way. And about that&mdash;about
      the success of the affair&mdash;I suppose there can be no question
      whatever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the slightest,&rdquo; Thorpe assured him. &ldquo;Rubber Consols can go up to any
      figure we choose to name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden proffered the cigar case again, and once more helped himself
      after he had given his companion a light. Then he threw himself back
      against the cushions, with a long sigh of content. &ldquo;I'm not going to say
      another word about myself,&rdquo; he announced, pleasantly. &ldquo;I've had more than
      my legitimate innings. You mustn't think that I forget for a moment the
      reverse of the medal. You're doing wonderful things for me. I only wish it
      were clearer to me what the wonderful things are that I can do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that'll be all right,&rdquo; said the other, rather vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it's a little early for you to have mapped out in your mind just
      what you want to do,&rdquo; Plowden reflected aloud. &ldquo;Of course it has come
      suddenly upon you&mdash;just as it has upon me. There are things in plenty
      that we've dreamed of doing, while the power to do them was a long way
      off. It doesn't at all follow that these are the things we shall proceed
      to do, when the power is actually in our hands. But have you any plans at
      all? Do you fancy going into Parliament, for example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Thorpe, meditatively. &ldquo;I think I should like to go into
      Parliament. But that would be some way ahead. I guess I've got my plans
      worked out a trifle more than you think. They may not be very definite, as
      regards details, but their main direction I know well enough. I'm going to
      be an English country gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden visibly winced a little at this announcement. He seemed
      annoyed at the consciousness that he had done so, turning abruptly first
      to stare out of the window, then shifting his position on the seat, and at
      last stealing an uneasy glance toward his companion. Apparently his tongue
      was at a loss for an appropriate comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had lost none of these unwilling tokens of embarrassment. Plowden
      saw that at once, but it relieved even more than it surprised him to see
      also that Thorpe appeared not to mind. The older man, indeed, smiled in
      good-natured if somewhat ironical comprehension of the dumb-show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that'll be all right, too,&rdquo; he said, with the evident intention of
      reassurance. &ldquo;I can do it right enough, so far as the big things are
      concerned. It'll be in the little things that I'll want some steering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've already told you&mdash;you may command me to the utmost of my
      power,&rdquo; the other declared. Upon reflection, he was disposed to be ashamed
      of himself. His nerves and facial muscles had been guilty of an
      unpardonable lapse into snobbishness&mdash;and toward a man, too, who had
      been capable of behaviour more distinguished in its courtesy and
      generosity than any he had encountered in all the &ldquo;upper circles&rdquo; put
      together. He recalled all at once, moreover, that Thorpe's &ldquo;h's&rdquo; were
      perfect&mdash;aud, for some occult reason, this completed his confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow&rdquo;&mdash;he began again, confronting with verbal awkwardness
      the other's quizzical smile&mdash;&ldquo;don't think I doubt anything about you.
      I know well enough that you can do anything&mdash;be anything&mdash;you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you know, though, that I'm a public-school man,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plowden lifted his brows in unfeigned surprise. &ldquo;No&mdash;I didn't know
      that,&rdquo; he admitted, frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm a Paul's Pigeon,&rdquo; Thorpe went on, &ldquo;as they called them in my
      day. That's gone out now, I'm told, since they've moved to the big
      buildings in Hammersmith. I did very well at school, too; came out in the
      first fourteen. But my father wouldn't carry the thing any further. He
      insisted on my going into the shop when I left St. Paul's and learning the
      book-business. He had precisely the same kind of dynastic idea, you know,
      that you fellows have. His father and his grand-father had been
      booksellers, and he was going to hand on the tradition to me, and my son
      after me. That was his idea. And he thought that Paul's would help this&mdash;but
      that Oxford would kill it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, he was right there&mdash;but he was wrong in supposing there
      was a bookseller in me. I liked the books well enough, mind you&mdash;but
      damn the people that came to buy them, I couldn't stand it. You stood two
      hours watching to see that men didn't put volumes in their pockets, and at
      the end of that time you'd made a profit of ninepence. While you were
      doing up the parcel, some fellow walked off with a book worth
      eighteen-pence. It was too slow for me. I didn't hit it off with the old
      man, either. We didn't precisely quarrel, but I went off on my own hook. I
      hung about London for some years, trying this thing and that. Once I
      started a book-shop of my own&mdash;but I did no good here. Finally I
      turned it up altogether, and went to Australia. That was in 1882. I've
      been in almost every quarter of the globe since; I've known what it was to
      be shipwrecked in a monsoon, and I've lain down in a desert not expecting
      to get up again, with my belt tightened to its last hole for hunger&mdash;but
      I can't remember that I ever wished myself back in my father's book-shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plowden's fine eyes sparkled his appreciation of the other's mood. He was
      silent for a moment, then lifted his head as if something had occurred to
      him. &ldquo;You were speaking of the plan that you should succeed to your
      father's business&mdash;and your son after you&mdash;you're not married,
      are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe slowly shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our station is the next,&rdquo; said the younger man. &ldquo;It's a drive of
      something under two miles. You'd better light another cigar.&rdquo; He added, as
      if upon a casual afterthought: &ldquo;We can both of us think of marrying now.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      FOR the next two hours, Thorpe's thoughts were almost wholly occupied with
      various phases of the large subject of domestic service. He seemed
      suddenly to have been transported to some region populated exclusively by
      clean-shaven men in brown livery. One of these was holding a spirited
      horse outside the station, and when Lord Plowden had taken the reins, and
      Thorpe had gathered the rugs about his knees and feet, this menial
      silently associated himself with the young man who had accompanied them
      from town, on the back seat of the trap. With these people so close behind
      him, Thorpe felt that any intimate conversation was out of the question.
      Indeed, talk of any sort was not invited; the big horse burst forth with
      high, sprawling strides upon a career through the twilight, once the main
      road was reached, which it taxed all Plowden's energies to regulate. He
      kept up a continual murmuring monologue to the animal&mdash;&ldquo;So&mdash;so&mdash;quiet,
      my pet,&mdash;so&mdash;so&mdash;easy, my beauty&mdash;-so&mdash;so&rdquo;&mdash;and
      his wrists and gloved hands were visibly under a tremendous tension of
      strain, as they held their own against the rigid arched neck and mouth of
      steel. Thorpe kept a grip on the side of the trap, and had only a modified
      pleasure in the drive. The road along which they sped seemed, in the
      gathering dusk, uncomfortably narrow, and he speculated a good deal as to
      how frightened the two mutes behind him must be. But silence was such a
      law of their life that, though he strained his ears, he could not so much
      as hear them sigh or gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed but a very few minutes before they turned off, with but the most
      fleeting diminution of pace, upon a private road, which speedily developed
      into an avenue of trees, quite dark and apparently narrower than ever.
      Down this they raced precipitately, and then, coming out all at once upon
      an open space, swung smartly round the crescent of a gravel road, and
      halted before what seemed to be the door of a greenhouse. Thorpe, as he
      stood up in the trap, got an uncertain, general idea of a low,
      pale-coloured mansion in the background, with lights showing behind
      curtains in several widely separated windows; what he had taken to be a
      conservatory revealed itself now to be a glass gallery, built along the
      front of the central portion of this house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A profusion of hospitable lights&mdash;tall wax-candles in brackets among
      the vines against the trellised wall&mdash;gave to this outlying entrance
      what the stranger felt to be a delightful effect. Its smooth tiled floor,
      comfortably bestrewn with rugs, was on a level with the path outside.
      There were low easy-chairs here, and a little wicker table bearing books
      and a lady's work-basket. Further on, giant chrysanthemum blooms were
      massed beneath the clusters of pale plumbago-flowers on the trellis.
      Directly in front, across the dozen feet of this glazed vestibule, the
      broad doorway of the house proper stood open&mdash;with warm lights
      glowing richly upon dark woods in the luxurious obscurity within.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Thorpe noted most of all, however, was the servants who seemed to
      swarm everywhere. The two who had alighted from the trap had contrived
      somehow mysteriously to multiply themselves in the darkness. All at once
      there were a number of young men&mdash;at the horse's head, at the back
      and sides of the trap, at the first doorway, and the second, and beyond&mdash;each
      presenting such a smooth-faced, pallid, brown-clad replica of all the
      others that Thorpe knew he should never be able to tell them apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden paused for a moment under the candle-light to look at his
      watch. &ldquo;We did it in a bit over eight minutes,&rdquo; he remarked, with obvious
      satisfaction. &ldquo;With four people and heavy roads that's not so bad&mdash;not
      so bad. But come inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They moved forward through the wide doorway into an apartment the like of
      which Thorpe had not seen before. It was a large, square room, with a big
      staircase at the end, which separated and went off to right and left,
      half-way up its visible course. Its floor was of inlaid woods, old and
      uneven from long use, and carpeted here and there by the skins of tigers
      and leopards. There were many other suggestions of the chase about the
      room: riding boots, whips, spurs, and some stands of archaic weapons
      caught the eye at various points; the heads of foxes and deer peeped out
      on the blackened panels of the walls, from among clusters of hooks crowded
      with coats, hats, and mackintoshes. At the right, where a fire glowed and
      blazed under a huge open chimney-place, there were low chairs and divans
      drawn up to mark off a space for orderly domestic occupation. The
      irregularity of every thing outside&mdash;the great table in the centre of
      the hall strewn with an incongruous litter of caps, books, flasks,
      newspapers, gloves, tobacco-pouches; the shoes, slippers, and leggings
      scattered under the benches at the sides&mdash;all this self-renewing
      disorder of a careless household struck Thorpe with a profound surprise.
      It was like nothing so much as a Mexican ranch&mdash;and to find it in the
      ancestral home of an English nobleman, filled to overflowing with
      servants, amazed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glances that he cast about him, however, were impassive enough. His
      mind was charged with the ceaseless responsibility of being astonished at
      nothing. A man took his hat, and helped him off with his coat. Another
      moved toward the staircase with his two bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will follow Pangbourn,&rdquo; said his host, indicating this second
      domestic, &ldquo;he will look after you. You would like to go up and change now,
      wouldn't you? There's a fire in your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus dismissed, he went up the stairs in the wake of his portmanteaus,
      taking the turning to the left, and then proceeding by a long, low
      passage, round more than one corner, to what he conceived to be a wing of
      the house. The servant ushered him into a room&mdash;and, in despite of
      himself, he sighed with pleasure at the sight of it. The prettiest and
      most charming of rooms it seemed to him to be&mdash;spacious and quaintly
      rambling in shape, with a delicately-figured chintz repeating the dainty
      effects of the walls upon the curtains and carpet and bed-hangings and
      chair-covers, and with a bright fire in the grate throwing its warm, cozy
      glow over everything. He looked at the pictures on the walls, at the
      photographs and little ornaments on the writing desk, and the high posts
      and silken coverlet of the big bed, and, secure in the averted face of the
      servant, smiled richly to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This servant, kneeling, had unstrapped and opened the new bags. Thorpe
      looked to see him quit the room, this task accomplished, and was conscious
      of something like dismay at the discovery that he intended to unpack them
      as well. Pangbourn began gravely to unwrap one paper parcel after another
      and to assort their contents in little heaps on the sofa beside him. He
      did it deftly, imperturbably, as if all the gentlemen he had ever seen
      carried their belongings in packages done up by tradesmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe's impulse to bid him desist framed itself in words on the tip of
      his tongue&mdash;but he did not utter these words. After circling idly,
      hands in pockets, about the man and the bags for a little time, he
      invented something which it seemed better for him to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you'll be able to make of those things,&rdquo; he remarked,
      casually. &ldquo;My man has been buying them today&mdash;and I don't know what
      he mayn't have forgotten. My whole outfit of that sort of thing went
      astray or was stolen at some station or other&mdash;the first part of the
      week&mdash;I think it must have been Leeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Pangbourn, without emotion. &ldquo;They're very careless, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on impassively, shaking out the black garments and spreading them
      on the bed, laying out a shirt and tie beside them, and arranging the
      razors, strop, and brushes on the dressing-table. He seemed to foresee
      everything&mdash;for there was not an instant's hesitation in the
      clock-like assiduity of his movements, as he bestowed handkerchiefs, in
      one drawer, socks in another, hung pyjamas before the fire, and set the
      patent-leather pumps against the fender. Even the old Mexican
      shooting-suit seemed in no way to disconcert him. He drew forth its
      constituent elements as with a practised hand; when he had hung them up,
      sombrero and all, in the wardrobe against the wall, they had the trick of
      making that venerable oaken receptacle look as if it had been fashioned
      expressly for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe's earlier uneasiness quite lost itself in his admiration for
      Pangbourn's resourceful dexterity. The delighted thought that now he would
      be needing a man like this for himself crossed his mind. Conceivably he
      might even get this identical Pangbourn&mdash;treasure though he were.
      Money could command everything on this broad globe&mdash;and why not
      Pangbourn? He tentatively felt of the coins in his pocket, as it became
      apparent that the man's task was nearing completion&mdash;and then frowned
      at himself for forgetting that these things were always reserved for the
      end of a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you dress now, sir?&rdquo; asked Pangbourn. His soft, distinct enunciation
      conveyed the suggestion of centuries of training.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Thorpe, finding himself for the moment behind the other's
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you require me any further, sir?&rdquo; the man reframed the question,
      deferentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Oh&mdash;no,&rdquo; replied Thorpe. &ldquo;No&mdash;I'll get along all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, he began hurriedly the task of shaving and dressing. The
      candles on either side of the thick, bevelled swinging mirror presented a
      somewhat embarrassing contrast to the electric light he was used to&mdash;but
      upon second thought he preferred this restrained aristocratic glimmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had completed his toilet, and was standing at the bay-window, with his
      shoulder holding back the edge of the curtain, looking out upon the
      darkened lawn and wondering whether he ought to go downstairs or wait for
      someone to summon him, when he heard a knock at his door. Before he could
      answer, the door opened, and he made out in the candle-and firelight that
      it was Lord Plowden who had come in. He stepped forward to meet his host
      who, clad now in evening-clothes, was smoking a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they looked after you all right?&rdquo; said Plowden, nonchalantly. &ldquo;Have
      a cigarette before we go down? Light it by the candle. They never will
      keep matches in a bedroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself in an easy-chair before the fire, as he spoke, and
      stretched out his shining slippers toward the grate. &ldquo;I thought I'd tell
      you before we went down&rdquo;&mdash;he went on, as Thorpe, with an elbow on the
      mantel, looked down at his handsome head&mdash;&ldquo;my sister has a couple of
      ladies visiting her. One of them I think you know. Do you remember on
      shipboard a Miss Madden&mdash;an American, you know&mdash;very tall and
      fine, with bright red hair&mdash;rather remarkable hair it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember the lady,&rdquo; said Thorpe, upon reflection, &ldquo;but we didn't meet.&rdquo;
       He could not wholly divest his tone of the hint that in those days it by
      no means followed that because he saw ladies it was open to him to know
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden smiled a little. &ldquo;Oh, you'll like her. She's great fun&mdash;if
      she's in the mood. My mother and sister&mdash;I had them call on her in
      London last spring&mdash;and they took a great fancy to her. She's got no
      end of money, you know&mdash;at least a million and a half&mdash;dollars,
      unfortunately. Her parents were Irish&mdash;her father made his pile in
      the waggon business, I believe&mdash;but she's as American as if they'd
      crossed over in&mdash;what was it, the 'Sunflower'?&mdash;no, the
      'Mayflower.' Marvelous country for assimilation, that America is! You
      remember what I told you&mdash;it's put such a mark on you that I should
      never have dreamt you were English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe observed his companion, through a blue haze of smoke, in silence.
      This insistence upon the un-English nature of the effect he produced was
      not altogether grateful to his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other one,&rdquo; continued Plowden, &ldquo;is Lady Cressage. You'll be
      interested in her&mdash;because a few years ago she was supposed to be the
      most beautiful woman in London. She married a shocking bounder&mdash;he
      would have been Duke of Glastonbury, though, if he had lived&mdash;but he
      was drowned, and she was left poor as a church mouse. Oh! by the way!&rdquo; he
      started up, with a gleam of aroused interest on his face&mdash;&ldquo;it didn't
      in the least occur to me. Why, she's a daughter of our General Kervick.
      How did he get on the Board, by the way? Where did you pick him up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe bent his brows in puzzled lines. &ldquo;Why, you introduced me to him
      yourself, didn't you?&rdquo; he asked, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plowden seemed unaffectedly surprised at the suggestion, as he turned it
      over in his mind. &ldquo;By George! I think you're right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'd quite
      forgotten it. Of course I did. Let me see&mdash;oh yes, I reconstruct it
      readily enough now. Poor old chappie&mdash;he needs all he can get. He was
      bothering her about money&mdash;that was it, I remember now&mdash;but what
      an idiot I was to forget it. But what I was saying&mdash;there's no one
      else but my mother and sister, and my brother Balder. He's a youngster&mdash;twenty
      or thereabouts&mdash;and he purports to be reading for his exams for the
      Army. If they opened his head, though, I doubt if they'd find anything but
      cricket and football, unless it might be a bit of golf. Well&mdash;that's
      the party. I thought you might like to have a notion of them in advance.
      If you've finished your cigarette&rdquo;&mdash;he threw his own into the grate,
      and rose as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;we may as well be moving along. By the way,&rdquo;
       he concluded, as they walked toward the door, &ldquo;I've an idea that we won't
      say anything, just at the moment, about our great coup. I should like to
      keep it as a little surprise&mdash;for my mother and sister, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some two hours later, Thorpe found the leisure and the restored equanimity
      needful for a dispassionate survey of his surroundings. He had become
      temporarily detached from the group over by the fireplace in the big
      drawing-room and was for the first time that evening very much at his
      ease. It was all much simpler, upon experiment, than he had feared. He
      stood now in a corner of the ornate apartment, whither he had wandered in
      examining the pictures on the walls, and contemplated with serenity the
      five people whom he had left behind him. He was conscious of the
      conviction that when he rejoined them, it would be on a new footing of
      assured equality. He knew now the exact measure of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Balder Plowden&mdash;a tall, heavily-built youth, with enormous
      shoulders and thick, hard hands, and pale straw-coloured hair and brows
      and eyelashes&mdash;had amiably sauntered beside him, and was elucidating
      for his benefit now, in slow, halting undertones, some unfathomable
      mystery connected with the varying attitude of two distinct breeds of
      terriers toward rats. Across the room, just within reach of the flickering
      ruddy firelight from the hearth, the American guest, Miss Madden, was
      seated at the piano, playing some low and rather doleful music. Thorpe
      bent his head, and assumed an air of attention, but in truth he listened
      to neither the Honourable Balder nor the piano. His thoughts were
      concentrated jealously upon his own position in this novel setting. He
      said to himself that it was all right. Old Lady Plowden had seemed to like
      him from the start. The genial, if somewhat abstracted, motherliness of
      her welcome had been, indeed, his sheet anchor throughout the evening. She
      had not once failed to nod her head and smile and twinkle her little kind
      eyes through their spectacles at him, whenever by word or look he had
      addressed her. Nor did his original half-suspicion, that this was her
      manner to people in general, justify itself upon observation. She was
      civil, even excessively civil, to the other two guests, but these ladies
      did not get the same eager and intent smile that he could command. He
      reasoned it out that Plowden must have said something pleasant to his
      mother about him&mdash;perhaps even to the point of explaining that he was
      to be the architect of their fortunes&mdash;but he did not like to ascribe
      all her hospitable warmth to that. It was dear to him to believe that she
      liked him on his own merits&mdash;and he did believe it, as his softened
      glance rested upon her where she sat almost facing him in her padded,
      wicker chair&mdash;small, white-haired, rosy-cheeked, her intelligent face
      radiating a kind of alert placidity which somehow made him feel at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been as much at home with the others. The Honourable Balder, of
      course, didn't count; nobody paid attention to him, and least of all a
      busy Rubber King. He gave not much more heed to the American&mdash;the
      tall young woman with the red hair and the million and a half of dollars.
      She was plainly a visitor like himself, not at all identified with the
      inner life of the household. He fancied, moreover, that she in no way
      desired to be thus identified. She seemed to carry herself with a
      deliberate aloofness underlying her surface amiability. Then he had spoken
      his few words with her, once or twice, he had got this effect of stony
      reserve close beneath her smile and smooth words. True, this might mean
      only that she felt herself out of her element, just as he did&mdash;but to
      him, really it did not matter what she felt. A year ago&mdash;why, yes,
      even a fortnight ago&mdash;the golden rumour of millions would have shone
      round her auburn hair in his eyes like a halo. But all that was changed.
      Calculated in a solidified currency, her reported fortune shrank to a mere
      three hundred thousand pounds. It was a respectable sum for a woman to
      have, no doubt, but it did nothing to quicken the cool indifference with
      which he considered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two other young women were different. They were seated together on a
      sofa, so placed as regarded his point of view, that he saw only in part
      the shadowed profiles of the faces they turned toward the piano. Although
      it was not visible to him, the posture of their shoulders told him that
      they were listening to the music each holding the other's hand. This tacit
      embrace was typical in his mind of the way they hung together, these two
      young women. It had been forced upon his perceptions all the evening, that
      this fair-haired, beautiful, rather stately Lady Cressage, and the small,
      swarthy, round-shouldered daughter of the house, peering through her
      pince-nez from under unduly thick black brows, formed a party of their
      own. Their politeness toward him had been as identical in all its little
      shades of distance and reservation as if they had been governed from a
      single brain-centre. It would be unfair to them to assume from their
      manner that they disliked him, or were even unfavourably impressed by him.
      The finesse of that manner was far too delicate a thing to call into use
      such rough characterizations. It was rather their action as a unit which
      piqued his interest. He thought he could see that they united upon a
      common demeanour toward the American girl, although of course they knew
      her much better than they knew him. It was not even clear to him that
      there were not traces of this combination in their tone toward Plowden and
      the Honourable Balder. The bond between them had twisted in it strands of
      social exclusiveness, and strands of sex sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not analyze all this with much closeness in his thoughts, but the
      impressions of it were distinct enough to him. He rather enjoyed these
      impressions than otherwise. Women had not often interested him
      consecutively to any large degree, either in detail or as a whole. He had
      formulated, among other loose general notions of them, however, the idea
      that their failure to stand by one another was one of their gravest
      weaknesses. This proposition rose suddenly now in his mind, and claimed
      his attention. It became apparent to him, all at once, that his opinions
      about women would be henceforth invested with a new importance. He had
      scarcely before in his life worn evening dress in a domestic circle which
      included ladies&mdash;certainly never in the presence of such certificated
      and hall-marked ladies as these. His future, however, was to be filled
      with experiences of this nature. Already, after this briefest of ventures
      into the new life, he found fresh conceptions of the great subject
      springing up in his thoughts. In this matter of women sticking together,
      for example&mdash;here before his eyes was one of the prettiest instances
      of it imaginable. As he looked again at the two figures on the sofa, so
      markedly unlike in outward aspect, yet knit to each other in such a
      sisterly bond, he found the spectacle really touching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage had inclined her classic profile even more toward the piano.
      Thorpe was not stirred at all by the music, but the spirit of it as it was
      reflected upon this beautiful facial outline&mdash;sensitive,
      high-spirited, somewhat sad withal&mdash;appealed to something in him. He
      moved forward cautiously, noiselessly, a dozen restricted paces, and
      halted again at the corner of a table. It was a relief that the Honourable
      Balder, though he followed along, respected now his obvious wish for
      silence. But neither Balder nor anyone else could guess that the music
      said less than nothing to his ears&mdash;that it was the face that had
      beckoned him to advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Covertly, with momentary assurances that no one observed him, he studied
      this face and mused upon it. The white candle-light on the shining wall
      beyond threw everything into a soft, uniform shadow, this side of the
      thread of dark tracery which outlined forehead and nose and lips and chin.
      It seemed to him that the eyes were closed, as in reverie; he could not be
      sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she would have been a Duchess if her husband had lived! He said to
      himself that he had never seen before, or imagined, a face which belonged
      so indubitably beneath a tiara of strawberry leaves in diamonds. The pride
      and grace and composure, yes, and melancholy, of the great lady&mdash;they
      were all there in their supreme expression. And yet&mdash;why, she was no
      great lady at all. She was the daughter of his old General Kervick&mdash;the
      necessitous and haughtily-humble old military gentleman, with the grey
      moustache and the premature fur coat, who did what he was told on the
      Board without a question, for a pitiful three hundred a year. Yes&mdash;she
      was his daughter, and she also was poor. Plowden had said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had Plowden, by the way, been so keen about relieving her from her
      father's importunities? He must have had it very much at heart, to have
      invented the roundabout plan of getting the old gentleman a directorship.
      But no&mdash;there was nothing in that. Why, Plowden had even forgotten
      that it was he who suggested Kervick's name. It would have been his
      sister, of course, who was evidently such chums with Lady Cressage, who
      gave him the hint to help the General to something if he could. And when
      you came to think of it, these aristocrats and military men and so on, had
      no other notion of making money save by directorships. Clearly, that was
      the way of it. Plowden had remembered Kervick's name, when the chance
      arose to give the old boy a leg up, and then had clean forgotten the
      circumstance. The episode rather increased his liking for Plowden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced briefly, under the impulse of his thought, to where the peer
      sat, or rather sprawled, in a big low chair before the fire. He was so
      nearly recumbent in it, indeed, that there was nothing to be seen of him
      but an elbow, and two very trim legs extended to the brass fender.
      Thorpe's gaze reverted automatically to the face of General Kervick's
      daughter. He wondered if she knew about the Company, and about him, and
      about his ability to solidify to any extent her father's financial
      position. Even more, upon reflection, he wondered whether she was very
      fond of her father; would she be extremely grateful to one who should
      render him securely comfortable for life? Miss Madden rose from the piano
      before Thorpe noted that the music had ceased. There came from the others
      a soft but fervent chorus of exclamations, the sincerity and enthusiasm of
      which made him a little ashamed. He had evidently been deaf to something
      that deeply moved the rest. Even Balder made remarks which seemed to be
      regarded as apposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What IS it?&rdquo; asked Lady Cressage, with obvious feeling. &ldquo;I don't know
      when anything has touched me so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Danish songs that I picked up on the quai in Paris for a franc or
      two,&rdquo; replied Miss Madden. &ldquo;I arranged and harmonized them&mdash;and,
      oddly enough, the result is rather Keltic, don't you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all of us Kelts in our welcome to music&mdash;and musicians&mdash;like
      this,&rdquo; affirmed Lord Plowden, who had scrambled to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      With sudden resolution, Thorpe moved forward and joined the conversation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      THORPE'S life-long habit of early rising brought him downstairs next
      morning before anybody else in the house, apparently, was astir. At all
      events, he saw no one in either the hall or the glass vestibule, as he
      wandered about. Both doors were wide open, however, to the mild, damp
      morning air. He found on one of the racks a cap that was less
      uncomfortable than the others, and sauntered forth to look about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His nerves were by no means in so serene a state as his reason told him
      they ought to be. The disquieting impression of bad dreams hung about him.
      The waking hour&mdash;always an evil time for him in these latter days of
      anxiety&mdash;had been this morning a peculiarly depressing affair. It had
      seemed to him, in the first minutes of reviving consciousness, that he was
      a hopelessly ruined and discredited man; the illusion of disaster had
      been, indeed, so complete and vivid that, even now, more than an hour
      later, he had not shaken off its effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      He applied his mental energies, as he strolled along the gravel paths, to
      the task of reassuring himself. There were still elements of chance in the
      game, of course, but it was easy enough, here in the daylight, to
      demonstrate that they had been cut down to a minimum&mdash;that it was
      nonsense to borrow trouble about them. He reviewed the situation in
      painstaking detail, and at every point it was all right, or as nearly all
      right as any human business could be. He scolded himself sharply for this
      foolish susceptibility to the intimidation of nightmares. &ldquo;Look at
      Plowden!&rdquo; he bade his dolorous spirit. &ldquo;See how easy he takes things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was undeniable that Lord Plowden took things very easily indeed. He had
      talked with eloquence and feeling about the miseries and humiliations of a
      peerage inadequately endowed with money, but no traces of his sufferings
      were visible to Thorpe's observant eye. The nobleman himself looked the
      very image of contented prosperity&mdash;handsome, buoyant, light-hearted,
      and, withal, the best-groomed man in London. And this ancestral home of
      his&mdash;or of his mother's, since he seemed to insist upon the
      distinction&mdash;where were its signs of a stinted income? The place was
      overrun with servants. There was a horse which covered a distance of
      something like two miles in eight minutes. Inside and out, Hadlow House
      suggested nothing but assured plenty. Yet its master told the most
      unvarying tales of poverty, and no doubt they were in one sense true. What
      he wished to fix his mind upon, and to draw strength for himself from, was
      the gay courage with which these Plowdens behaved as if they were rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grounds at the front of the house, hemmed in by high hedges and trees
      from what seemed to be a public road beyond, were fairly spacious, but the
      sleek decorum of their arrangement, while it pleased him, was scarcely
      interesting. He liked better to study the house itself, which in the
      daylight revealed itself as his ideal of what a historic English
      country-house of the minor class should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a period in his youth when architecture had attracted him
      greatly as offering a congenial and lucrative career. Not much remained to
      him now of the classifications and phraseology which he had gone to the
      trouble of memorizing, in that far-off time, but he still looked at
      buildings with a kind of professional consciousness. Hadlow House said
      intelligible things to him, and he was pleased with himself for
      understanding them. It was not new in any part, apparently, but there was
      nothing pretentious in its antiquity. It had never been a castle, or a
      fortified residence. No violent alteration in habits or needs
      distinguished its present occupants from its original builders. It had
      been planned and reared as a home for gentle people, at some
      not-too-remote date when it was already possible for gentle people to have
      homes, without fighting to defend them. One could fancy that its calm and
      infinitely comfortable history had never been ruffled from that day to
      this. He recalled having heard it mentioned the previous evening that the
      house stood upon the site of an old monastery. No doubt that accounted for
      its being built in a hollow, with the ground-floor on the absolute level
      of the earth outside. The monks had always chosen these low-lying
      sheltered spots for their cloisters. Why should they have done so? he
      wondered&mdash;and then came to a sudden mental stop, absorbed in a
      somewhat surprised contemplation of a new version of himself. He was
      becoming literary, historical, bookish! His mind had begun to throw open
      again, to abstract thoughts and musings, its long-closed doors. He had
      read and dreamed so much as a lad, in the old book-shop! For many years
      that boyhood of eager concern in the printed page had seemed to him to
      belong to somebody else. Now, all at once, it came back to him as his own
      possession; he felt that he could take up books again where he had dropped
      them, perhaps even with the old rapt, intent zest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visions rose before him of the magnificent library he would gather for
      himself. And it should be in no wise for show&mdash;the gross ostentation
      of the unlettered parvenu&mdash;but a genuine library, which should
      minister to his own individual culture. The thought took instant hold upon
      his interest. By that road, his progress to the goal of gentility would be
      smooth and simple. He seemed not to have reasoned it out to himself in
      detail before, but now, at all events, he saw his way clearly enough. Why
      should he be tormented with doubts and misgivings about himself, as if he
      had come out of the gutter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why indeed? He had passed through&mdash;and with credit, too&mdash;one of
      the great public schools of England. He had been there on a footing of
      perfect equality, so far as he saw, with the sons of aristocratic families
      or of great City potentates. And as to birth, he had behind him three
      generations at least of scholarly men, men who knew the contents, as well
      as the commercial value, of the books they handled.
    </p>
    <p>
      His grandfather had been a man of note in his calling. The tradition of
      Lord Althorp's confidence in him, and of how he requited it by securing
      Caxton's &ldquo;Golden Legend&rdquo; for the library of that distinguished collector,
      under the very nose of his hot rival, the Duke of Marlborough, was
      tenderly cherished as an heirloom in the old shop. And Thorpe's father,
      too, though no such single achievement crowned his memory, had been the
      adviser and, as one might say, the friend of many notable writers and
      patrons of literature. The son of such forbears needed only money to be
      recognized by everybody as a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his mother's side, now that he thought of it, there was something
      perhaps better still than a heritage of librarians' craft and tastes. His
      mother's maiden name was Stormont, and he remembered well enough the
      solemnity with which she had always alluded to the fact, in the course of
      domestic discussions. Who the Stormonts were he could not recall that he
      had ever learned, but his mother had been very clear indeed about their
      superiority to the usual ruck of people. He would ask his sister whether
      she knew anything about them. In the meantime there was no denying that
      Stormont was a fine-sounding name. He reflected that it was his own middle
      name&mdash;and, on the instant, fancy engraved for him a card-plate on
      which appeared the legend&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Stormont Thorpe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an inspiration! &ldquo;Joel&rdquo; he had not used for so many years that now,
      after six months' familiarity with it on his sister's lips, he could not
      get accustomed to it. The colourless and non-committal style of &ldquo;J. S.
      Thorpe,&rdquo; under which he had lived so long, had been well enough for the
      term of his exile&mdash;the weary time of obscure toil and suspense. But
      now, in this sunburst of smiling fortune, when he had achieved the right
      to a name of distinction&mdash;here it was ready to his hand. A fleeting
      question as to whether he should carry the &ldquo;J&rdquo; along as an initial put
      itself to his mind. He decided vigorously against it. He had always had a
      prejudice against men who, in the transatlantic phrase, parted either
      their hair or their names in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made his unheeding way past the house to the beginning of the
      avenue of trees, which he remembered from the previous evening's drive. To
      his right, an open space of roadway led off in the direction of the
      stables. As he hesitated, in momentary doubt which course to take, the
      sound of hoofs in the avenue caught his ear, and he stood still. In a
      moment there came into view, round a curve in the leafy distance, two
      horses with riders, advancing at a brisk canter. Soon he perceived that
      the riders were ladies; they drew rein as they approached him, and then it
      was to be seen that they were the pair he had judged to be such close
      friends last night&mdash;Lady Cressage and the daughter of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      They smiled and nodded down at him, as he lifted his cap and bowed. Their
      cheeks were glowing and their eyes sparkling with the exhilaration of
      their ride. Even the Hon. Winifred looked comely and distinguished in his
      eyes, under the charm of this heightened vivacity. She seemed to carry
      herself better in the saddle than she did out of it; the sweep of her
      habit below the stirrup lent dignity to her figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her companion, whose big chestnut mount was pacing slowly toward the
      stepping-block&mdash;how should he bring within the compass of thought the
      impressions he had had of her as she passed? There seemed to have been no
      memory in his mind to prepare him for the beauty of the picture she had
      made. Slender, erect, exquisitely-tailored, she had gone by like some
      queen in a pageant, gracious yet unapproachable. He stared after her,
      mutely bewildered at the effect she produced upon him&mdash;until he saw
      that a groom had run from the stable-yard, and was helping the divinity to
      dismount. The angry thought that he might have done this himself rose
      within him&mdash;but there followed swiftly enough the answering
      conviction that he lacked the courage. He did not even advance to proffer
      his services to the other young lady, while there was still time. The
      truth was, he admitted ruefully to himself, they unnerved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had talked freely enough to them, or rather to the company of which
      they made part, the previous evening. There had been an hour or more,
      indeed, before the party broke up, in which he had borne the lion's share
      of the talk&mdash;and they had appeared as frankly entertained as the
      others. In fact, when he recalled the circle of faces to which he had
      addressed his monologue of reminiscences&mdash;curious experiences and
      adventures in Java and the Argentine, in Brazil and the Antilles and
      Mexico and the far West&mdash;it was in the face of Lady Cressage that he
      seemed to discern the most genuine interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should she frighten him, then, by daylight? The whimsical theory that
      the wine at dinner had given him a spurious courage occurred to him. He
      shrugged his shoulders at it, and, with his hands in his pockets, turned
      toward the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stable-yard is, from some points of view, the prettiest thing about
      Hadlow. There is a big, uneven, grass-grown space, in the centre of which,
      from a slight mound, springs an aged oak of tremendous girth and height.
      All around this enclosure are buildings of the same pale yellowish brick
      as the mansion itself, but quaintly differing one from another in design
      and size. Stables, carriage-houses, kennels, a laundry, a brewery, and
      half a dozen structures the intention of which is now somewhat uncertain&mdash;some
      flat-topped, some gabled, others with turrets, or massive grouped
      chimneys, or overhanging timbered upper stories&mdash;form round this
      unkempt, shadowed green a sort of village, with a communal individuality
      of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glance shows its feudal relation to, and dependence upon, the great
      house behind which it nestles; some of the back-kitchens and offices of
      this great house, indeed, straggle out till they meet and merge themselves
      into this quadrangle. None the less, it presents to the enquiring gaze a
      specific character, of as old a growth, one might think, as the oak
      itself. Here servants have lived, it may be, since man first learned the
      trick of setting his foot on his brother's neck. Plainly enough, the
      monks' servants lived and worked here; half the buildings on the side
      nearest the house belong to their time, and one of them still bears a
      partially-defaced coat of arms that must have belonged to an Abbot. And
      when lay lord succeeded cleric, only the garb and vocabulary of servitude
      were altered in this square. Its population crossed themselves less, and
      worked much harder, but they remained in a world of their own, adjacent
      aud subject to the world of their masters, yet separated from it by oh!
      such countless and unthinkable distances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe sauntered along the side of the stables. He counted three men and a
      boy who visibly belonged to this department. The dog-cart of the previous
      evening had been run out upon the brick-pavement which drained the
      stables, and glistened with expensive smartness now beneath the sponge of
      one of the hostlers. Under cover, he discerned two other carriages, and
      there seemed to be at least half a dozen horses. The men who, in the half
      gloom of the loose-boxes, were busy grooming these animals made a curious
      whistling noise as they worked. Everybody in the yard touched a forelock
      to him as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this quaint, old-world enclosure he wandered at his leisure, through
      an open gate in the wall at the back, into the gardens behind the house.
      There was not much in the way of flowers to look at, but he moved about
      quite unconscious of any deprivation. A cluster of greenhouses, massed
      against the southern side of the mansion, attracted his listless fancy,
      and he walked toward what appeared to be an entrance to them. The door was
      locked, but he found another further on which opened to his hand. The air
      was very hot and moist inside, and the place was so filled with
      broad-leaved, umbrageous tropical plants that he had to stoop to make his
      way through to the end. The next house had a more tolerable atmosphere,
      and contained some blossoms to which he gave momentary attention. In the
      third house, through the glass-door, he could see a man&mdash;evidently a
      gardener&mdash;lifting some pots to a shelf overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought occurred to him that by entering into conversation with this
      man, he might indirectly obtain a hint as to the usual breakfast-hour at
      Hadlow. It was now nearly ten o'clock, and he was getting very hungry.
      Would they not ring a bell, or sound a gong, or something? he wondered.
      Perhaps there had been some such summons, and he had not heard it. It
      might be the intelligent thing for him to return to the house, at all
      events, and sit in the hall where the servants could see him, in case the
      meal was in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking idly through the glass at the gardener, meanwhile, it suddenly
      dawned upon him that the face and figure were familiar. He stared more
      intently at the man, casting about in his memory for a clue to his
      identity. It came to him that the person he had in mind was a fellow named
      Gafferson, who had kept an impoverished and down-at-the-heels sort of
      hotel and general store on the road from Belize to Boon Town, in British
      Honduras. Yes, it undoubtedly was Gafferson. What on earth was he doing
      here? Thorpe gave but brief consideration to this problem. It was of more
      immediate importance to recall the circumstances of his contact with the
      man. He had made Gafferson's poor shanty of an hotel his headquarters for
      the better part of a month&mdash;the base of supplies from which he made
      numerous prospecting tours into the mountains of the interior. Had he paid
      his bill on leaving? Yes, there was no doubt about that. He could even
      recall a certain pity for the unbusiness-like scale of charges, and the
      lack of perception of opportunity, which characterized the bill in
      question. He remembered now his impression that Gafferson would never do
      any good. It would be interesting to know what kind of an impression he,
      in turn, had produced on his thriftless host. At any rate, there was no
      good reason why he should not find out. He opened the door and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gardener barely looked up from his occupation, and drew aside to let
      the newcomer pass with no sign of a gesture toward his cap. Thorpe halted,
      and tried to look at the pots on the staging as if he knew about such
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asked, in the tentative tone of one who is in no
      need of information, but desires to be affable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drying off the first lot of gloxinias,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;Some people
      put 'em on their sides, but I like 'em upright, close to the glass. It
      stands to reason, if you think about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; said Thorpe, with conviction. In his mind he contrasted
      the independence of Gafferson's manner with the practised servility of the
      stable-yard&mdash;and thought that he liked it&mdash;and then was not so
      sure. He perceived that there was no recognition of him. The gardener, as
      further desultory conversation about his work progressed, looked his
      interlocutor full in the face, but with a placid, sheep-like gaze which
      seemed to be entirely insensible to variations in the human species.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you ever get back here to England?&rdquo; Thorpe was emboldened to ask
      at last. In comment upon the other's stare of puzzled enquiry, he went on:
      &ldquo;You're Gafferson, aren't you? I thought so. When I last saw you, you were
      running a sort of half-way house, t'other side of Belize. That was in
      '90.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gafferson&mdash;a thick-set, squat man of middle age, with a straggling
      reddish beard&mdash;turned upon him a tranquil but uninformed eye. &ldquo;I
      suppose you would have been stopping at Government House,&rdquo; he remarked.
      &ldquo;That was in Sir Roger Goldsworthy's time. They used to come out often to
      see my flowers. And so you remembered my name. I suppose it was because of
      the Gaffersoniana hybrids. There was a good bit in the papers about them
      last spring.&rdquo; Thorpe nodded an assent which it seemed better not to put
      into words. &ldquo;Well, it beats all,&rdquo; he mused aloud. &ldquo;Why, man, there's gold
      in those mountains! You had an inside track on prospecting, placed as you
      were. And there's cocoa&mdash;and some day they'll coin money in rubber,
      too. All that country's waiting for is better communications. And you were
      on the spot, and knew all the lay of the land&mdash;and yet here you are
      back in England, getting so much a month for messing about in the mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw swiftly that his reflections had carried him beyond his earlier
      limit, and with rapidity decided upon frankness. &ldquo;No, I wasn't in the
      Governor's outfit at all. I was looking for gold then&mdash;with
      occasionally an eye on rubber. I stopped at your place. Don't you remember
      me? My name's Thorpe. I had a beard then. Why, man, you and one of your
      niggers were with me three or four days once, up on the ridge beyond the
      Burnt Hills&mdash;why, you remember, the nigger was from San Domingo, and
      he was forever bragging about the San Domingo peppers, and saying those on
      the mainland hadn't enough strength to make a baby wrinkle his nose, and
      you found a pepper coming through the swamp, and you tipped me the wink,
      and you handed that pepper to the nigger, and it damned near killed him.
      Hell! You must remember that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would have been the Chavica pertusum,&rdquo; said Gafferson, thoughtfully.
      He seemed to rouse himself to an interest in the story itself with some
      difficulty. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I remember it,&rdquo; he admitted, finally. &ldquo;I shouldn't
      have known you though. I'm the worst in the world about remembering
      people. It seems to be growing on me. I notice that when I go up to London
      to the shows, I don't remember the men that I had the longest talks with
      the time before. Once you get wrapped up in your flowers, you've got no
      room in your head for anything else&mdash;that's the way of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe considered him with a ruminating eye. &ldquo;So this is the sort of thing
      you really like, eh? You'd rather be doing this, eh? than making your pile
      in logwood and mahogany out there, or floating a gold mine?&rdquo; Gafferson
      answered quite simply: &ldquo;I wasn't the kind to ever make a pile. I got led
      into going out there when I was a youngster, and there didn't seem to be
      any good in trying to get back, but I wasn't making more than a bare
      living when you were there, and after that I didn't even do that much. It
      took me a good many years to find out what my real fancy was. I hated my
      hotel and my store, but I was crazy about my garden. Finally an American
      gentleman came along one day, and he put up at my place, and he saw that I
      was as near ruined as they make 'em, and he says to me, 'You're no good to
      run a hotel, nor yet a store, and this aint your country for a cent. What
      you're born for is to grow flowers. You can't afford to do it here,
      because nobody'll pay you for it, but you gather up your seeds and roots
      and so on, and come along with me to Atlanta, Georgia, and I'll put fat on
      your bones.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what he said to me, and I took him at his word, and I was with him
      two years, and then I thought I'd like to come to England, and since then
      I've worked my way up here, till now I take a Royal Horticultural medal
      regular, and there's a clematis with salmon-coloured bars that'll be in
      the market next spring that's named after my master. And what could I ask
      more 'n that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Thorpe. &ldquo;What time do they have breakfast here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gardener's round, phlegmatic, florid countenance had taken on a mild
      glow of animation during his narrative. It relapsed into lethargy at the
      advent of this new topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me they eat at all hours,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But if you want to see
      his Lordship,&rdquo; he went on, considering, &ldquo;about noon would be your best
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See his Lordship!&rdquo; repeated Thorpe, with an impatient grin. &ldquo;Why I'm a
      guest here in the house. All I want is something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A guest,&rdquo; Gafferson repeated in turn, slowly. There was nothing
      unpleasant in the intonation, and Thorpe's sharp glance failed to detect
      any trace of offensive intention in his companion's fatuous visage. Yet it
      seemed to pass between the two men that Gafferson was surprised, and that
      there were abundant grounds for his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Thorpe, with as much nonchalance as he could summon,
      &ldquo;your master is one of my directors. I've taken a fancy to him, and I'm
      going to make a rich man of him. He was keen about my seeing his place
      here, and kept urging me to come, and so finally I've got away over Sunday
      to oblige him. By the way&mdash;I shall buy an estate in the country as
      soon as the right thing offers, and I shall want to set up no end of
      gardens and greenhouses and all that. I see that I couldn't come to a
      better man than you for advice. I daresay I'll put the whole arrangement
      of it in your hands. You'd like that, wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever his Lordship agrees to,&rdquo; the gardener replied, sententiously. He
      turned to the staging, and took up one of the pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe swung on his heel, and moved briskly toward the further door, which
      he could see opened upon the lawn. He was conscious of annoyance with this
      moon-faced, dawdling Gafferson, who had been afforded such a splendid
      chance of profiting by an old acquaintanceship&mdash;it might even be
      called, as things went in Honduras, a friendship&mdash;and who had so
      clumsily failed to rise to the situation. The bitter thought of going back
      and giving him a half-crown rose in Thorpe's inventive mind, and he paused
      for an instant, his hand on the door-knob, to think it over. The gratuity
      would certainly put Gafferson in his place, but then the spirit in which
      it was offered would be wholly lost on his dull brain. And moreover, was
      it so certain that he would take it? He had not said &ldquo;sir&rdquo; once, and he
      had talked about medals with the pride of a scientist. The rules were
      overwhelmingly against a gardener rejecting a tip, of course, but if there
      was no more than one chance in twenty of it, Thorpe decided that he could
      not afford the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He quitted the greenhouse with resolution, and directed his steps toward
      the front of the mansion. As he entered the hall, a remarkably tuneful and
      resonant chime filled his ears with novel music. He looked and saw that a
      white-capped, neatly-clad domestic, standing with her back to him beside
      the newel-post of the stairs, was beating out the tune with two padded
      sticks upon some strips of metal ranged on a stand of Indian workmanship.
      The sound was delightful, but even more so was the implication that it
      betokened breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      With inspiration, he drew forth the half-crown which he had been fingering
      in his pocket, and gave it to the girl as she turned. &ldquo;That's the kind of
      concert I like,&rdquo; he declared, bestowing the patronage of a jovial smile
      upon her pleased and comely face. &ldquo;Show me the way to this breakfast that
      you've been serenading about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out in the greenhouse, meanwhile, Gafferson continued to regard blankly
      the shrivelled, fatty leaves of the plant he had taken up. &ldquo;Thorpe,&rdquo; he
      said aloud, as if addressing the tabid gloxinia&mdash;&ldquo;Thorpe&mdash;yes&mdash;I
      remember his initials&mdash;J. S. Thorpe. Now, who's the man that told me
      about him? and what was it he told me?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE experiences of the breakfast room were very agreeable indeed. Thorpe
      found himself the only man present, and, after the first few minutes of
      embarrassment at this discovery, it filled him with surprised delight to
      note how perfectly he was at his ease. He could never have imagined
      himself seated with four ladies at a table&mdash;three of them, moreover,
      ladies of title&mdash;and doing it all so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one thing, the ladies themselves had a morning manner, so to speak,
      which differed widely from the impressions he had had of their deportment
      the previous evening. They seemed now to be as simple and fresh and
      natural as the unadorned frocks they wore. They listened with an air of
      good-fellowship to him when he spoke; they smiled at the right places;
      they acted as if they liked him, and were glad of his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The satisfied conviction that he was talking well, and behaving well,
      accompanied him in his progress through the meal. His confession at the
      outset of his great hunger, and of the sinister apprehensions which had
      assailed him in his loitering walk about the place, proved a most
      fortuitous beginning; after that, they were ready to regard everything he
      said as amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, when we're by ourselves,&rdquo; the kindly little old hostess explained to
      him, &ldquo;my daughter and I breakfast always at nine. That was our hour
      yesterday morning, for example. But when my son is here, then it's
      farewell to regularity. We put breakfast back till ten, then, as a kind of
      compromise between our own early habits and his lack of any sort of
      habits. Why we do it I couldn't say&mdash;because he never comes down in
      any event. He sleeps so well at Hadlow&mdash;and you know in town he
      sleeps very ill indeed&mdash;and so we don't dream of complaining. We're
      only too glad&mdash;for his sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Balder,&rdquo; commented the sister, &ldquo;he's as bad the other way. He gets up
      at some unearthly hour, and has his tea and a sandwich from the
      still-room, and goes off with his rod or his gun or the dogs, and we never
      see him till luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been on the point of asking so many times,&rdquo; Miss Madden interposed&mdash;&ldquo;is
      Balder a family name, or is it after the Viking in Matthew Arnold's poem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was his father's choice,&rdquo; Lady Plowden made answer. &ldquo;I think the
      Viking explanation is the right one&mdash;it certainly isn't in either
      family. I can't say that it attracted me much&mdash;at first, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it fits him so splendidly,&rdquo; said Lady Cressage. &ldquo;He looks the
      part, as they say. I always thought it was the best of all the soldier
      names&mdash;and you have only to look at him to see that he was
      predestined for a soldier from his cradle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish the Sandhurst people would have a good long look at him, then,&rdquo;
       put in the mother with earnestness underlying the jest of her tone. &ldquo;The
      poor boy will never pass those exams in the world. It IS ridiculous, as
      his father always said. If there ever was a man who was made for a
      soldier, it's Balder. He's a gentleman, and he's connected by tradition
      with the Army, and he's mad about everything military&mdash;and surely
      he's as clever as anybody else at everything except that wretched matter
      of books, and even there it's only a defect of memory&mdash;and yet that
      suffices to prevent his serving his Queen. And all over England there are
      young gentlemen like that&mdash;the very pick of the hunting-fields,
      strong and brave as lions, fit to lead men anywhere, the very men England
      wants to have fighting her battles&mdash;and they can't get places in the
      Army because&mdash;what was it Balder came to grief over last time?&mdash;because
      they can't remember whether it's Ispahan or Teheran that's the capital of
      Persia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are the fine old sort that would go and capture both places at the
      point of the bayonet&mdash;and find out their names afterward&mdash;but it
      seems that's not what the Army wants nowadays. What is desired now is
      superior clerks, and secretaries and professors of languages&mdash;and
      much good they will do us when the time of trouble comes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think the purchase-system was better?&rdquo; asked the American lady.
      &ldquo;It always seemed to me that that must have worked so curiously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prefer it?&rdquo; said Lady Plowden. &ldquo;A thousand times yes! My husband made one
      of the best speeches in the debate on it&mdash;one do I say?&mdash;first
      and last he must have made a dozen of them. If anything could have kept
      the House of Lords firm, in the face of the wretched Radical outcry, it
      would have been those speeches. He pointed out all the evils that would
      follow the change. You might have called it prophetic&mdash;the way he
      foresaw what would happen to Balder&mdash;or not Balder in particular, of
      course, but that whole class of young gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he said, you have only to ask yourself what kind of people the lower
      classes naturally look up to and obey and follow. Will they be ordered
      about by a man simply because he knows Greek and Latin and Hebrew? Do they
      respect the village schoolmaster, for example, on account of his learning?
      Not in the very slightest! On the contrary, they regard him with the
      greatest contempt. The man they will serve is the man whose birth gives
      him the right to command them, or else the man with money in his pockets
      to make it worth their while. These two are the only leaders they
      understand. And if that's true here in England, in times of peace, among
      our own people, how much truer must it be of our soldiers, away from
      England, in a time of war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mamma,&rdquo; the Hon. Winifred intervened, &ldquo;don't you see how badly that
      might work nowadays? now that the good families have so little money, and
      all the fortunes are in the hands of stockjobbing people&mdash;and so on?
      It would be THEIR sons who would buy all the commissions&mdash;and I'm
      sure Balder wouldn't get on at all with that lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Plowden answered with decision and great promptness. &ldquo;You see so
      little of the world, Winnie dear, that you don't get very clear ideas of
      its movements. The people who make fortunes in England are every whit as
      important to its welfare as those who inherit names, and individually I'm
      sure they are often much more deserving. Every generation sniffs at its
      nouveaux riches, but by the next they have become merged in the
      aristocracy. It isn't a new thing in England at all. It has always been
      that way. Two-thirds of the peerage have their start from a wealthy
      merchant, or some other person who made a fortune. They are really the
      back-bone of England. You should keep that always in mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;I see what you mean&rdquo;&mdash;Winnie replied, her dark cheek
      flushing faintly under the tacit reproof. She had passed her twenty-fifth
      birthday, but her voice had in it the docile self-repression of a
      school-girl. She spoke with diffident slowness, her gaze fastened upon her
      plate. &ldquo;Of course&mdash;my grandfather was a lawyer&mdash;and your point
      is that merchants&mdash;and others who make fortunes&mdash;would be the
      same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Lady Plowden. &ldquo;And do tell us, Mr. Thorpe&rdquo;&mdash;she
      turned toward where he sat at her right and beamed at him over her
      spectacles, with the air of having been wearied with a conversation in
      which he bore no part&mdash;&ldquo;is it really true that social discontent is
      becoming more marked in America, even, than it is with us in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not an American, you know,&rdquo; he reminded her. &ldquo;I only know one or two
      sections of the country&mdash;and those only as a stranger. You should ask
      Miss Madden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Celia. &ldquo;Oh, I haven't come up for my examinations yet. I'm like
      Balder&mdash;I'm preparing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I should like Mr. Thorpe to tell us,&rdquo; suggested Lady Cressage,
      mildly, &ldquo;is about the flowers in the tropics&mdash;in Java, for example,
      or some of the West Indies. One hears such marvelous tales about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of flowers,&rdquo; Thorpe suddenly decided to mention the fact; &ldquo;I met
      out in one of the greenhouses here this morning, an old acquaintance of
      mine, the gardener, Gafferson. The last time I saw him, he was running the
      worst hotel in the world in the worst country in the world&mdash;out in
      British Honduras.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he's a wonderful gardener,&rdquo; said Lady Cressage. &ldquo;He's a magician; he
      can do what he likes with plants. It's rather a hobby of mine&mdash;or
      used to be&mdash;and I never saw his equal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe told them about Gafferson, in that forlorn environment on the
      Belize road, and his success in making them laugh drew him on to other
      pictures of the droll side of life among the misfits of adventure. The
      ladies visibly dallied over their tea-cups to listen to him; the charm of
      having them all to himself, and of holding them in interested
      entertainment by his discourse&mdash;these ladies of supremely refined
      associations and position&mdash;seemed to provide an inspiration of its
      own. He could hear that his voice was automatically modulating itself to
      their critical ears. His language was producing itself with as much
      delicacy of selection as if it came out of a book&mdash;and yet preserving
      the savour of quaint, outlandish idiom which his listeners clearly liked.
      Upon the instant when Lady Plowden's gathering of skirts, and glance
      across the table, warned him that they were to rise, he said deliberately
      to himself that this had been the most enjoyable episode of his whole
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were cigar boxes on the fine old oak mantel, out in the hall, and
      Winnie indicated them to him with the obvious suggestion that he was
      expected to smoke. He looked her over as he lit his cigar&mdash;where she
      stood spreading her hands above the blaze of the logs, and concluded that
      she was much nicer upon acquaintance than he had thought. Her slight
      figure might not be beautiful, but beyond doubt its lines were ladylike.
      The same extenuating word applied itself in his mind to her thin and
      swarthy, though distinguished, features. They bore the stamp of caste, and
      so did the way she looked at one through her eye-glasses, from under those
      over-heavy black eyebrows, holding her head a little to one side. Though
      it was easy enough to guess that she had a spirit of her own, her gentle,
      almost anxious, deference to her mother had shown that she had it under
      admirable control.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had read about her in a peerage at his sister's book-shop the previous
      day. Unfortunately it did not give her age, but that was not so important,
      after all. She was styled Honourable. She was the daughter of one Viscount
      and the sister of another. Her grandfather had been an Earl, and the book
      had shown her to possess a bewildering number of relationships among
      titled folks. All this was very interesting to him&mdash;and somewhat
      suggestive. Vague, shapeless hints at projects rose in his brain as he
      looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you think my brother has odd notions of entertaining his
      guests,&rdquo; she remarked to him, over her shoulder. The other ladies had not
      joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm all right,&rdquo; he protested cordially. &ldquo;I should hate to have him
      put himself out in the slightest.&rdquo; Upon consideration he added: &ldquo;I suppose
      he has given up the idea of shooting to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; she answered.&rdquo; The keeper was about this morning, that is&mdash;and
      he doesn't often come unless they are to go out with the guns. I suppose
      you are very fond of shooting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I've done some&mdash;in my time,&rdquo; Thorpe replied, cautiously.
      It did not seem necessary to explain that he had yet to fire his first gun
      on English soil. &ldquo;It's a good many years,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;since I had the
      time and opportunity to do much at it. I think the last shooting I did was
      alligators. You hit 'em in the eye, you know. But what kind of a hand I
      shall make of it with a shot-gun, I haven't the least idea. Is the
      shooting round I here pretty good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it's anything remarkable. Plowden says my brother Balder
      kills all the birds off every season. Balder's by way of being a
      crack-shot, you know. There are some pheasants, though. We saw them flying
      when we were out this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe wondered if it would be possible to consult her upon the question
      of apparel. Clearly, he ought to make some difference in his garb, yet the
      mental vision of him-self in those old Mexican clothes revealed itself now
      as ridiculously impossible. He must have been out of his mind to have
      conceived anything so preposterous as rigging himself out, among these
      polished people, like a cow-puncher down on his luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder when your brother will expect to start,&rdquo; he began, uneasily.
      &ldquo;Perhaps I ought to go and get ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here comes his man,&rdquo; remarked the sister. A round-faced,
      smooth-mannered youngster&mdash;whom Thorpe discovered to be wearing
      cord-breeches and leather leggings as he descended the stairs&mdash;advanced
      toward him and prefaced his message by the invariable salutation. &ldquo;His
      Lordship will be down, sir, in ten minutes&mdash;and he hopes you'll be
      ready, sir,&rdquo; the valet said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Pangbourn to this gentleman's room,&rdquo; Miss Winnie bade him, and with
      a gesture of comprehensive submission he went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calm readiness with which she had provided a solution for his
      difficulties impressed Thorpe greatly. It would never have occurred to him
      that Pangbourn was the answer to the problem of his clothes, yet how
      obvious it had been to her. These old families did something more than
      fill their houses with servants; they mastered the art of making these
      servants an integral part of the machinery of existence. Fancy having a
      man to do all your thinking about clothes for you, and then dress you,
      into the bargain. Oh, it was all splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that we're going shooting,&rdquo; Thorpe found himself explaining, a
      few moments later in his bedroom, to the attentive Pangbourn. He decided
      to throw himself with frankness upon the domestic's resourceful
      good-feeling. &ldquo;I haven't brought anything for shooting at all. Somehow I
      got the idea we were going to do rough riding instead&mdash;and so I
      fetched along some old Mexican riding-clothes that make me feel more at
      home in the saddle than anything else would. You know how fond a man gets
      of old, loose things like that. But about this shooting&mdash;I want you
      to fix me out. What do I need? Just some breeches and leggings, eh? You
      can manage them for me, can't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pangbourn could and did&mdash;and it was upon his advice that the Mexican
      jacket was utilized to complete the out-fit. Its shape was beyond doubt
      uncommon, but it had big pockets, and it looked like business. Thorpe, as
      he glanced up and down his image in the tall mirror of the wardrobe, felt
      that he must kill a large number of birds to justify the effect of
      pitiless proficiency which this jacket lent to his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will find a cap below, sir,&rdquo; Pangbourn announced, with serenity, and
      Thorpe, who had been tentatively fingering the big, flaring sombrero,
      thrust it back upon its peg as if it had proved too hot to handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downstairs in the hall there was more waiting to be done, and there was
      nobody now to bear him company. He lit another cigar, tried on various
      caps till he found a leathern one to suit him, and then dawdled about the
      room and the adjoining conservatory for what seemed to him more than half
      an hour. This phase of the aristocratic routine, he felt, did not commend
      itself so warmly to him as did some others. Everybody else, however,
      seemed to regard it as so wholly a matter of course that Plowden should do
      as he liked, that he forbore formulating a complaint even to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, this nobleman's valet descended the stairs once more. &ldquo;His
      Lordship will be down very shortly now, sir,&rdquo; he declared&mdash;&ldquo;and will
      you be good enough to come into the gun-room, sir, and see the keeper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe followed him through a doorway under the staircase&mdash;the
      existence of which he had not suspected&mdash;into a bare-looking
      apartment fitted like a pantry with shelves. After the semi-gloom of the
      hall, it was almost glaringly lighted. The windows and another door
      opened, he saw, upon a court connected with the stable-yard. By this
      entrance, no doubt, had come the keeper, a small, brown-faced,
      brown-clothed man of mature years, with the strap of a pouch over his
      shoulder, who stood looking at the contents of the shelves. He
      mechanically saluted Thorpe in turn, and then resumed his occupation.
      There were numerous gun cases on the lower shelf, and many boxes and bags
      above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did his Lordship say what gun?&rdquo; the keeper demanded of the valet. He had
      a bright-eyed, intent glance, and his tone conveyed a sense of some broad,
      impersonal, out-of-doors disdain for liveried house-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valet, standing behind Thorpe, shrugged his shoulders and eloquently
      shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like an 'ammerless, sir?&rdquo; the keeper turned to Thorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his intense humiliation, Thorpe could not make out the meaning of the
      query. &ldquo;Oh, anything'll do for me,&rdquo; he said, awkwardly smiling. &ldquo;It's
      years since I've shot&mdash;I daresay one gun'll be quite the same as
      another to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt the knowing bright eyes of the keeper taking all his measurements
      as a sportsman. &ldquo;You'd do best with 'B,' sir, I fancy,&rdquo; the functionary
      decided at last, and his way of saying it gave Thorpe the notion that &ldquo;B&rdquo;
       must be the weapon that was reserved for school-boys. He watched the
      operation of putting the gun together, and then took it, and laid it over
      his arm, and followed the valet out into the hall again, in dignified
      silence. To the keeper's remark&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Balder has its mate with him
      today, sir,&rdquo; he gave only a restrained nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were even now whole minutes to wait before Lord Plowden appeared. He
      came down the stairs then with the brisk, rather impatient air of a busy
      man whose plans are embarrassed by the unpunctuality of others. He was
      fully attired, hob-nailed shoes, leggings, leather coat and cap, gloves,
      scarf round his throat and all&mdash;and he behaved as if there was not a
      minute to lose. He had barely time to shake perfunctorily the hand Thorpe
      offered him, and utter an absent-minded &ldquo;How are you this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the valet, who hurried forward to open the outer door, bearing his
      master's gun and a camp-stool, he said reproachfully, &ldquo;We are very late
      today, Barnes.&rdquo; They went out, and began striding down the avenue of trees
      at such a pace that the keeper and his following of small boys and dogs,
      who joined them near the road, were forced into a trot to keep up with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had fancied, somehow, that a day's shooting would afford
      exceptional opportunities for quiet and intimate talk with his host, but
      he perceived very soon that this was not to be the case. They walked
      together for half a mile, it is true, along a rural bye-road first and
      then across some fields, but the party was close at their heels, and
      Plowden walked so fast that conversation of any sort, save an occasional
      remark about the birds and the covers between him and the keeper, was
      impracticable. The Hon. Balder suddenly turned up in the landscape,
      leaning against a gate set in a hedgerow, and their course was deflected
      toward him, but even when they came up to him, the expedition seemed to
      gain nothing of a social character. The few curt words that were
      exchanged, as they halted here to distribute cartridges and hold brief
      consultation, bore exclusively upon the subject in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keeper assumed now an authority which Thorpe, breathing heavily over
      the unwonted exercise and hoping for nothing so much as that they would
      henceforth take things easy, thought intolerable. He was amazed that the
      two brothers should take without cavil the arbitrary orders of this
      elderly peasant. He bade Lord Plowden proceed to a certain point in one
      direction, and that nobleman, followed by his valet with the gun and the
      stool, set meekly off without a word. Balder, with equal docility, vaulted
      the gate, and moved away down the lane at the bidding of the keeper.
      Neither of them had intervened to mitigate the destiny of their guest, or
      displayed any interest as to what was going to become of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe said to himself that he did not like this&mdash;and though
      afterward, when he had also climbed the gate and taken up his station
      under a clump of trees at the autocrat's behest, he strove to soothe his
      ruffled feelings by the argument that it was probably the absolutely
      correct deportment for a shooting party, his mind remained unconvinced.
      Moreover, in parting from him, the keeper had dropped a blunt injunction
      about firing up or down the lane, the tone even more than the matter of
      which nettled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cap all, when he presently ventured to stroll about a little from the
      spot on which he had been planted, he caught a glimpse against the skyline
      of the distant Lord Plowden, comfortably seated on the stool which his
      valet had been carrying. It seemed to Thorpe at that moment that he had
      never wanted to sit down so much before in his life&mdash;and he turned on
      his heel in the wet grass with a grunt of displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mood vanished utterly a few moments later. The remote sounds had
      begun to come to him, of boys shouting and dogs barking, in the recesses
      of the strip of woodland which the lane skirted, and at these he hastened
      back to his post. It did not seem to him a good place, and when he heard
      the reports of guns to right and left of him, and nothing came his way, he
      liked it less than ever; it had become a matter of offended pride with
      him, however, to relieve the keeper of no atom of the responsibility he
      had taken upon himself. If Lord Plowden's guest had no sport, the blame
      for it should rest upon Lord Plowden's over-arrogant keeper. Then a noise
      of a different character assailed his ears, punctuated as it were by
      distant boyish cries of &ldquo;mark!&rdquo; These cries, and the buzzing sound as of
      clockwork gone wrong which they accompanied and heralded, became all at
      once a most urgent affair of his own. He strained his eyes upon the
      horizon of the thicket&mdash;and, as if by instinct, the gun sprang up to
      adjust its sight to this eager gaze, and followed automatically the
      thundering course of the big bird, and then, taking thought to itself,
      leaped ahead of it and fired. Thorpe's first pheasant reeled in the air,
      described a somersault, and fell like a plummet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stirred not a step, but reloaded the barrel with a hand shaking for
      joy. From where he stood he could see the dead bird; there could never
      have been a cleaner &ldquo;kill.&rdquo; In the warming glow of his satisfaction in
      himself, there kindled a new liking of a different sort for Plowden and
      Balder. He owed to them, at this belated hour of his life, a novel delight
      of indescribable charm. There came to him, from the woods, the shrill
      bucolic voice of the keeper, admonishing a wayward dog. He was conscious
      of even a certain tenderness for this keeper&mdash;and again the cry of
      &ldquo;mark!&rdquo; rose, strenuously addressed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the wood had been cleared, and Thorpe saw the rest of
      the party assembling by the gate. He did not hurry to join them, but when
      Lord Plowden appeared he sauntered slowly over, gun over arm, with as
      indifferent an air as he could simulate. It pleased him tremendously that
      no one had thought it worth while to approach the rendezvous by way of the
      spot he had covered. His eye took instant stock of the game carried by two
      of the boys; their combined prizes were eight birds and a rabbit, and his
      heart leaped within him at the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Thorpe?&rdquo; asked Plowden, pleasantly. The smell of gunpowder and the
      sight of stained feathers had co-operated to brighten and cheer his mood.
      &ldquo;I heard you blazing away in great form. Did you get anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe strove hard to give his voice a careless note. &ldquo;Let some of the
      boys run over,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;There are nine birds within sight, and
      there are two or three in the bushes&mdash;but they may have got away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; said Balder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo; was his brother's comment&mdash;and Thorpe permitted
      himself the luxury of a long-drawn, beaming sigh of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roseate colouring of this triumph seemed really to tint everything
      that remained of Thorpe's visit. He set down to it without hesitation the
      visible augmentation of deference to him among the servants. The
      temptation was very great to believe that it had affected the ladies of
      the house as well. He could not say that they were more gracious to him,
      but certainly they appeared to take him more for granted. In a hundred
      little ways, he seemed to perceive that he was no longer held mentally at
      arm's length as a stranger to their caste. Of course, his own restored
      self-confidence could account for much of this, but he clung to the
      whimsical conceit that much was also due to the fact that he was the man
      of the pheasants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday was bleak and stormy, and no one stirred out of the house. He was
      alone again with the ladies at breakfast, and during the long day he was
      much in their company. It was like no other day he had ever imagined to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, in the morning train by which he returned alone to town,
      his mind roved luxuriously among the fragrant memories of that day. He had
      been so perfectly at home&mdash;and in such a home! There were some things
      which came uppermost again and again&mdash;but of them all he dwelt most
      fixedly upon the recollection of moving about in the greenhouses and
      conservatories, with that tall, stately, fair Lady Cressage for his guide,
      and watching her instead of the flowers that she pointed out. Of what she
      had told him, not a syllable stuck in his mind, but the music of the voice
      lingered in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she is old Kervick's daughter!&rdquo; he said to himself more than once.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT may be that every other passenger in that morning train to London
      nursed either a silent rage, or declaimed aloud to fellow-sufferers in
      indignation, at the time consumed in making what, by the map, should be so
      brief a journey. In Thorpe's own compartment, men spoke with savage irony
      of cyclists alleged to be passing them on the road, and exchanged dark
      prophecies as to the novelties in imbecility and helplessness which the
      line would be preparing for the Christmas holidays. The old joke about
      people who had gone travelling years before, and were believed to be still
      lost somewhere in the recesses of Kent, revived itself amid gloomy
      approbation. The still older discussion as to whether the South Eastern or
      the Brighton was really the worst followed naturally in its wake, and
      occupied its accustomed half-hour&mdash;complicated, however, upon this
      occasion, by the chance presence of a loquacious stranger who said he
      lived on the Chatham-and-Dover, and who rejected boisterously the idea
      that any other railway could be half so bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intrusion of this outsider aroused instant resentment, and the
      champions of the South Eastern and the Brighton, having piled up
      additional defenses in the shape of personal recollections of delay and
      mismanagement quite beyond belief, made a combined attack upon the
      newcomer. He was evidently incapable, their remarks implied, of knowing a
      bad railway when he saw one. To suggest that the characterless and
      inoffensive Chatham-and-Dover, so commonplace in its tame virtues, was to
      be mentioned in the same breath with the daringly inventive and
      resourceful malefactors whose rendezvous was London Bridge, showed either
      a weak mind or a corrupt heart. Did this man really live on the Dover line
      at all? Angry countenances plainly reflected the doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to Thorpe the journey seemed short enough&mdash;almost too short. The
      conversation interested him not at all; if he had ever known the Southern
      lines apart, they were all one to him now. He looked out of the window,
      and could have sworn that he thought of nothing but the visit from which
      he was returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he alighted at Cannon Street, however, it was to discover that his
      mind was full of a large, new, carefully-prepared project. It came to him,
      ready-made and practically complete, as he stood on the platform,
      superintending the porter's efforts to find his bags. He turned it over
      and over in his thoughts, in the hansom, more to familiarize himself with
      its details than to add to them. He left the cab to wait for him at the
      mouth of a little alley which delves its way into Old Broad Street through
      towering walls of commercial buildings, old and new.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colin Semple was happily in his office&mdash;a congeries of small, huddled
      rooms, dry and dirty with age, which had a doorway of its own in a corner
      of the court&mdash;and Thorpe pushed on to his room at the end like one
      who is assured of both his way and his welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broker was standing beside a desk, dictating a letter to a clerk who
      sat at it, and with only a nod to Thorpe he proceeded to finish this task.
      He looked more than once at his visitor as he did so, in a preoccupied,
      impersonal way. To the other's notion, he seemed the personification of
      business&mdash;without an ounce of distracting superfluous flesh upon his
      wiry, tough little frame, without a trace of unnecessary politeness, or
      humour, or sensibility of any sort. He was the machine perfected and fined
      down to absolute essentials. He could understand a joke if it was useful
      to him to do so. He could drink, and even smoke cigarettes, with a natural
      air, if these exercises seemed properly to belong to the task he had in
      hand. Thorpe did not conceive him doing anything for the mere human reason
      that he liked to do it. There was more than a touch of what the rustic
      calls &ldquo;ginger&rdquo; in his hair and closely-cropped, pointed beard, and he had
      the complementary florid skin. His eyes&mdash;notably direct, confident
      eyes&mdash;were of a grey which had in it more brown than blue. He wore a
      black frock-coat, buttoned close, and his linen produced the effect of a
      conspicuous whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned as the clerk left the room, and let his serious, thin lips relax
      for an instant as a deferred greeting. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked, impassively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got a quarter-of-an-hour?&rdquo; asked Thorpe in turn. &ldquo;I want a talk
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer, Semple left the room. Returning after a minute or two, he
      remarked, &ldquo;Go ahead till we're stopped,&rdquo; and seated himself on the corner
      of the desk with the light inconsequence of a bird on a twig. Thorpe
      unbuttoned his overcoat, laid aside his hat, and seated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've worked out the whole scheme,&rdquo; he began, as if introducing the
      product of many sleepless nights' cogitations. &ldquo;I'm going to leave England
      almost immediately&mdash;go on the Continent and loaf about&mdash;I've
      never seen the Continent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Semple regarded him in silence. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he observed at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see the idea, don't you?&rdquo; Thorpe demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broker twitched his shoulders slightly. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the idea is everything,&rdquo; protested the other. &ldquo;We've been thinking of
      beginning the campaign straight away&mdash;but the true game now is to lie
      low&mdash;silent as the grave. I go away now, d'ye see? Nothing particular
      is said about it, of course, but in a month or two somebody notices that
      I'm not about, and he happens to mention it to somebody else&mdash;and so
      there gets to be the impression that things haven't gone well with me,
      d'ye see? On the same plan, I let all the clerks at my office go. The
      Secretary'll come round every once in a while to get letters, of course,
      and perhaps he'll keep a boy in the front office for show, but practically
      the place'll be shut up. That'll help out the general impression that I've
      gone to pieces. Now d'ye see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the Special Settlement you're thinking of,&rdquo; commented Semple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. The fellows that we're going to squeeze would move heaven and
      hell to prevent our getting that Settlement, if they got wind of what was
      going on. The only weak point in our game is just there. Absolutely
      everything hangs on the Settlement being granted. Naturally, then, our
      play is to concentrate everything on getting it granted. We don't want to
      raise the remotest shadow of a suspicion of what we're up to, till after
      we're safe past that rock. So we go on in the way to attract the least
      possible attention. You or your jobber makes the ordinary application for
      a Special Settlement, with your six signatures and so on; and I go abroad
      quietly, and the office is as good as shut up, and nobody makes a peep
      about Rubber Consols&mdash;and the thing works itself. You do see it,
      don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see well enough the things that are to be seen,&rdquo; replied Semple, with a
      certain brevity of manner. &ldquo;There was a sermon of my father's that I
      remember, and it had for its text, 'We look not at the things which are
      seen, but at the things which are not seen.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe, pondering this for a moment, nodded his head. &ldquo;Semple,&rdquo; he said,
      bringing his chair forward to the desk, &ldquo;that's what I've come for. I want
      to spread my cards on the table for you. I know the sum you've laid out
      already, in working this thing. We'll say that that is to be paid back to
      you, as a separate transaction, and we'll put that to one side. Now then,
      leaving that out of consideration, what do you think you ought to have out
      of the winnings, when we pull the thing off? Mind, I'm not thinking of
      your 2,000 vendor's shares&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I'm not thinking much of them, either,&rdquo; interposed Semple, with
      a kind of dry significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they'll be all right,&rdquo; Thorpe affirmed. He laughed unconsciously as
      he did so. &ldquo;No, what I want to get at is your idea of what should come to
      you, as a bonus, when I scoop the board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty thousand pounds,&rdquo; said Semple, readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe's slow glance brightened a trifle. &ldquo;I had thought thirty would be a
      fairer figure,&rdquo; he remarked, with an effort at simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broker put out his under-lip. &ldquo;You will find people rather disposed to
      distrust a man who promises more than he's asked,&rdquo; he remarked coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I know what you mean,&rdquo; Thorpe hurried to say, flushing
      awkwardly, even though the remark was so undeserved; &ldquo;but it's in my
      nature. I'm full of the notion of doing things for people that have done
      things for me. That's the way I'm built. Why&rdquo;&mdash;he halted to consider
      the advisability of disclosing what he had promised to do for Lord
      Plowden, and decided against it&mdash;&ldquo;why, without you, what would the
      whole thing have been worth to me? Take one thing alone&mdash;the money
      for the applications&mdash;I could have no more got at it than I could at
      the Crown Jewels in the Tower. I've wondered since, more than once&mdash;if
      you don't mind the question&mdash;how did you happen to have so much ready
      money lying about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some Glasgow and Aberdeen folk who trust me to invest for
      them,&rdquo; the broker explained. &ldquo;If they get five per cent. for the four
      months, they'll be very pleased. And so I shall be very pleased to take
      thirty thousand instead of twenty&mdash;if it presents itself to your mind
      in that way. You will give me a letter to that effect, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; assented Thorpe. &ldquo;Write it now, if you like.&rdquo; He pushed his
      chair forward, closer to the desk, and dipped a pen in the ink. &ldquo;What I
      want to do is this,&rdquo; he said, looking up. &ldquo;I'll make the promise for
      thirty-two thousand, and I'll get you to let me have two thousand in cash
      now&mdash;a personal advance. I shall need it, if I'm to hang about on the
      Continent for four months. I judge you think it'll be four months before
      things materialize, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Special Settlement, in the natural order of events, would come
      shortly after the Christmas holidays. That is nearly three months. Then
      the work of taking fort-nightly profits will begin&mdash;and it is for you
      to say how long you allow that to go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about the two thousand pounds now,&rdquo; Thorpe reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I will do that in this way,&rdquo; said Semple, kicking his small legs
      nonchalantly. &ldquo;I will buy two thousand fully-paid shares of you, for cash
      down, NOT vendor's shares, you observe&mdash;and then I will take your
      acknowledgment that you hold them for me in trust up to a given date. In
      that way, I would not at all weaken your market, and I would have a stake
      in the game.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your stake's pretty big, already,&rdquo; commented Thorpe,
      tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's just a fancy of mine,&rdquo; said the other, with his first smile. &ldquo;I like
      to hold shares that are making sensational advances. It is very exciting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Thorpe, in accents of resignation. He wrote out two
      letters, accepting the wording which Semple suggested from his perch on
      the desk, and then the latter, hopping down, took the chair in turn and
      wrote a cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want it open?&rdquo; he asked over his shoulder. &ldquo;Are you going to get
      it cashed at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;cross it,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I want it to go through my bankers.
      It'll warm their hearts toward me. I shan't be going till the end of the
      week, in any event. I suppose you know the Continent by heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, very little indeed. I've had business in Frankfort once,
      and in Rotterdam once, and in Paris twice. That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't you ever do anything for pleasure?&rdquo; Thorpe asked him, as he
      folded the cheque in his pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;many things,&rdquo; responded the broker, lightly. &ldquo;It's a
      pleasure, for example, to buy Rubber Consols at par.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you call it buying,&rdquo; said Thorpe, and then softened his words with
      an apologetic laugh. &ldquo;I didn't tell you, did I? I've been spending
      Saturday and Sunday with Plowden&mdash;you know, the Lord Plowden on my
      Board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of him very well,&rdquo; observed the Scotchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he a place that he asks people down to, then? That isn't the usual
      form with guinea-pigs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but, he isn't the guinea-pig variety at all,&rdquo; Thorpe asserted,
      warmly. &ldquo;He's really a splendid fellow&mdash;with his little oddities,
      like the rest of us, of course, but a decent chap all through. Place? I
      should think he HAD got a place! It's one of the swellest old
      country-houses you ever saw&mdash;older than hell, you know&mdash;and it's
      kept up as if they had fifty thousand a year. Do you happen to know what
      his real income is supposed to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Semple shook his head. He had taken his hat, and was smoothing it deftly
      with the palm of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked,&rdquo; Thorpe went on, &ldquo;because he had so much to say about his
      poverty. To hear him talk, you'd think the bailiffs were sitting on his
      doorstep. That doesn't prevent his having fast horses, and servants all
      over the place, and about the best shooting I've seen in the South of
      England. As luck would have it, I was in wonderful form. God! how I
      knocked the pheasants!&rdquo; A clerk showed his head at the door, with a
      meaning gesture. &ldquo;I must go now,&rdquo; said Semple, briskly, and led the way
      out to another room. He halted here, and dismissed his caller with the
      brief injunction, &ldquo;Don't go away without seeing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the noon-hour, and the least-considered grades of the City's slaves
      were in the streets on the quest for cheap luncheons. Thorpe noted the
      manner in which some of them studied the large bill of fare placarded
      beside a restaurant door; the spectacle prompted him luxuriously to rattle
      the gold coins remaining in his pocket. He had been as anxious about pence
      as the hungriest of those poor devils, only a week before. And now! He
      thrust up the door in the roof of the cab, and bade the driver stop at his
      bank. Thence, after some brief but very agreeable business, and a hurried
      inspection of the &ldquo;Court&rdquo; section of a London Directory, he drove to a
      telegraph station and despatched two messages. They were identical in
      terms. One sought General Kervick at his residence&mdash;he was in
      lodgings somewhere in the Hanover Square country&mdash;and the other
      looked for him at his club. Both begged him to lunch at the Savoy at two
      o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was time and to spare, now. Thorpe dismissed the cab at his hotel&mdash;an
      unpretentious house in Craven Street, and sent his luggage to his rooms.
      There were no letters for him on the board in the hallway, and he
      sauntered up to the Strand. As by force of habit, he turned presently into
      a side-street, and stopped opposite the ancient book-shop of his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bright yet mellow light of the sunny autumn noontide, the blacks
      and roans and smoked drabs of the low old brick front looked more dingy to
      his eye than ever. It spoke of antiquity, no doubt, but it was a dismal
      and graceless antiquity of narrow purposes and niggling thrift. It was so
      little like the antiquity, for example, of Hadlow House, that the two
      might have computed their age by the chronological systems of different
      planets. Although his sister's married name was Dabney, and she had been
      sole proprietor for nearly a dozen years, the sign over the doorway bore
      still its century-old legend, &ldquo;Thorpe, Bookseller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the street, and paused for a moment to run an eye over the
      books and placards exposed on either side of the entrance. A small boy
      guarded these wares, and Thorpe considered him briefly, with curious
      recollections of how much of his own boyhood had been spent on that very
      spot. The lad under observation had a loutish and sullen face; its
      expression could not have been more devoid of intellectual suggestions if
      he had been posted in a Wiltshire field to frighten crows with a rattle,
      instead of being set here in the highway of the world's brain-movement, an
      agent of students and philosophers. Thorpe wondered if in his time he
      could have looked such a vacant and sour young fool. No&mdash;no. That
      could not be. Boys were different in his day&mdash;and especially boys in
      book-shops. They read something and knew something of what they handled.
      They had some sort of aspirations, fitful and vague as these might be, to
      become in their time bookmen also. And in those days there still were
      bookmen&mdash;widely-informed, observant, devoted old bookmen&mdash;who
      loved their trade, and adorned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe reflected that, as he grew older, he was the better able to
      apprehend the admirable qualities of that departed race of literature's
      servants. Indeed, it seemed that he had never adequately realized before
      how proud a man might well be of descending from a line of such men. The
      thought struck him that very likely at this identical doorway, two
      generations back, a poor, out-at-the-elbows, young law-student named
      Plowden had stood and turned over pages of books he could not dream of
      buying. Perhaps, even, he had ventured inside, and deferentially picked
      acquaintance with the Thorpe of the period, and got bookish advice and
      friendly counsel for nothing. It was of no real significance that the
      law-student grew to be Lord Chancellor, and the bookseller remained a
      book-seller; in the realm of actual values, the Thorpes were as good as
      the Plowdens.
    </p>
    <p>
      A customer came out of the shop, and Thorpe went in, squeezing his way
      along the narrow passage between the tall rows of books, to the small open
      space at the end. His sister stood here, momentarily occupied at a high
      desk. She did not look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I visited his Lordship all right.&rdquo; He announced his presence
      thus genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you're the better for it,&rdquo; she remarked, turning to him, after a
      pause, her emotionless, plain face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, immensely,&rdquo; he affirmed, with robust jocularity. &ldquo;You should have
      seen the way they took to me. It was 'Mr. Thorpe' here and 'Mr. Thorpe'
      there, all over the place. Ladies of title, mind you&mdash;all to myself
      at breakfast two days running. And such ladies&mdash;finer than silk. Oh,
      it's clear as daylight&mdash;I was intended for a fashionable career.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled in a faint, passive way. &ldquo;Well&mdash;they say 'better late than
      never,' you know.&rdquo; &ldquo;And after all, IS it so very late?&rdquo; he said, adopting
      her phrase as an expression of his thought. &ldquo;I'm just turned forty, and I
      feel like a boy. I was looking at that 'Peerage' there, the other day&mdash;and
      do you know, I'm sixteen years younger than the first Lord Plowden was
      when they made him a peer? Why he didn't even get into the House of
      Commons until he was seven-and-forty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have the Plowden family on the brain,&rdquo; she commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have worse things. You've no idea, Lou, how nice it all is. The
      mother, Lady Plowden&mdash;why she made me feel as if I was at the very
      least a nephew of hers. And so simple and natural! She smiled at me, and
      listened to me, and said friendly things to me&mdash;why, just as anybody
      might have done. You'll just love her, when you know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louisa laughed in his face. &ldquo;Don't be a fool, Joel,&rdquo; she adjured him, with
      a flash of scornful mirth. He mingled a certain frowning impatience with
      the buoyancy of his smile. &ldquo;Why, of course, you'll know her,&rdquo; he
      protested. &ldquo;What nonsense you're thinking of! Do you suppose I'm going to
      allow you to mess about here with second-hand almanacs, and a sign in your
      window of 'threepence in the shilling discount for cash,' while I'm a
      millionaire? It's too foolish, Lou. You annoy me by supposing such a
      thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no good talking about it at all,&rdquo; she observed, after a little
      pause. &ldquo;It hasn't come off yet, for one thing. And as I said the other
      night, if you want to do things for the children, that's another matter.
      They're of an age when they can learn whatever anybody chooses to teach
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo; he asked. Upon the instant another plan began to
      unfold itself in the background of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're both at Cheltenham, though they're at different places, of
      course. I was recommended to send Julia there&mdash;one of our old
      customers is a Governor, or whatever it's called&mdash;and he got special
      terms for her. She was rather old, you know, to go to school, but he
      arranged it very nicely for her&mdash;and there is such a good boys'
      college there, it seemed the wisest thing to send Alfred too. Julia is to
      finish at Christmas-time&mdash;and what I'm going to do with her afterward
      is more than I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she pretty?&rdquo; the uncle of Julia enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's very nice,&rdquo; the mother answered, with vague extenuation in her
      tone. &ldquo;I don't know about her looks&mdash;she varies so much. Sometimes I
      think she's pretty&mdash;and then again I can't think it. She's got good
      features, and she holds herself well, and she's very much the lady&mdash;rather
      too much, I think, sometimes&mdash;but it all depends upon what you call
      pretty. She's not tall, you know. She takes after her father's family. The
      Dabneys are all little people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe seemed not to care about the Dabneys. &ldquo;And what's Alfred like?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to be an artist!&rdquo; There was a perceptible note of apprehension
      in the mother's confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;why shouldn't he&mdash;if he's got a bent that way?&rdquo; demanded
      Thorpe, with reproof in his tone. &ldquo;Did you want him to be a shop-keeper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see him a doctor,&rdquo; she replied with dignity. &ldquo;It was
      always my idea for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's no good&mdash;even as an idea,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Doctors are like
      parsons&mdash;they can't keep up with the times. The age is outgrowing
      them. Only the fakirs in either profession get anything out of it,
      nowadays. It's all mystery and sleight-of-hand and the confidence trick&mdash;medicine
      is&mdash;and if you haven't got just the right twist of the wrist, you're
      not in it. But an artist stands on his merits. There is his work&mdash;done
      by his own hands. It speaks for itself. There's no deception&mdash;it's
      easy enough to tell whether it's good or bad. If the pictures are good,
      people buy them. If they're bad, people don't buy them. Of course, it
      won't matter to Alfred, financially speaking, whether his pictures sell
      well or not. But probably he'd give it up, if he didn't make a hit of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that there's any crying need that he should do anything. My
      own idea for him, perhaps, would be the Army, but I wouldn't dream of
      forcing it on him against his will. I had a bitter enough dose of that,
      myself, with father. I'd try to guide a youngster, yes, and perhaps argue
      with him, if I thought he was making a jack of himself&mdash;but I
      wouldn't dictate. If Alfred thinks he wants to be an artist, in God's name
      let him go ahead. It can be made a gentlemanly trade&mdash;and the main
      thing is that he should be a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louisa had listened to this discourse with apathetic patience. &ldquo;If you
      don't mind, I don't know that I do,&rdquo; she said when it was finished.
      &ldquo;Perhaps he wouldn't have made a good doctor; he's got a very quick
      temper. He reminds me of father&mdash;oh, ever so much more than you do.
      He contradicts everything everybody says. He quite knows it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he's a good fellow, isn't he?&rdquo; urged Thorpe. &ldquo;I mean, he's got his
      likable points? I'm going to be able to get along with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't get along with him very well,&rdquo; the mother admitted, reluctantly,
      &ldquo;but I daresay with a man it would be different. You see, his father was
      ill all those four years, and Alfred hated the shop as bad as you did, and
      perhaps in my worry I blamed him more than was fair. I want to be fair to
      him, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is he a gentleman? That puts it in a word,&rdquo; Thorpe insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mercy yes,&rdquo; Louisa made ready answer. &ldquo;My only fear is&mdash;whether
      you won't find him too much of a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe knitted his brows. &ldquo;I only hope we're talking about the same
      thing,&rdquo; he said, in a doubtful tone. Before she could speak, he lifted his
      hand. &ldquo;Never mind&mdash;I can see for myself in ten minutes more than you
      could tell me in a lifetime. I've got a plan. I'm going on the Continent
      in a few days' time, to stay for three or four months. I've got nothing
      special to do&mdash;just to travel about and see things and kill time&mdash;I
      shall probably go to Italy and Switzerland and Paris and the Rhine and all
      sorts of places&mdash;and it occurred to me that I'd take the two
      youngsters with me. I could get acquainted with them, that way, and they'd
      be company for me. I've been lonesome so long, it would feel good to have
      some of my own flesh and blood about me&mdash;and I suppose they'd be
      tickled to death to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their schooling and board are paid for up to Christmas,&rdquo; Mrs. Dabney
      objected, blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; Thorpe prolonged the emphatic exclamation into something
      good-natured, and ended it with an abrupt laugh. &ldquo;What on earth difference
      does that make? I could go and buy their damned colleges, and let the kids
      wear them for breastpins if I wanted to. You said the girl was going to
      quit at Christmas in any case. Won't she learn more in four months
      travelling about on the Continent, than she would trotting around in her
      own tracks there at Cheltenham?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it's even more important for the boy. He's of an age when he ought to
      see something of the world, and I ought to see something of him. Whatever
      he's going to do, it's time that he began getting his special start for
      it.&rdquo; He added, upon a luminous afterthought: &ldquo;Perhaps his seeing the old
      Italian picture galleries and so on will cure him of wanting to be an
      artist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother's air displayed resigned acquiescence rather than conviction.
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;if you really think it's best,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I don't know that
      I ought to object. Goodness knows, I don't want to stand in their way.
      Ever since you sent that four hundred pounds, it hasn't seemed as if they
      were my children at all. They've scarcely listened to me. And now you
      come, and propose to take them out of my hands altogether&mdash;and all I
      can say is&mdash;I hope you feel entirely justified. And so, shall I write
      them to come home? When do you think of starting? Julia ought to have some
      travelling clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can wait till you get her ready&mdash;only you must hurry up about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Remembering something, he took out his cheque-book, and spread it on the
      desk. &ldquo;I will give you back that thirty,&rdquo; he said, as he wrote, &ldquo;and
      here's a hundred to get the youngsters ready. You won't waste any time,
      will you? and if you want more tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A customer had entered the shop, and Thorpe made it the occasion for
      leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister, looking after her brother with the cheque in her hand, was
      conscious of a thought which seemed to spell itself out in visible letters
      before her mental vision. &ldquo;Even now I don't believe in him,&rdquo; the
      impalpable legend ran.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      GENERAL KERVICK was by habit a punctual man, and Thorpe found him
      hovering, carefully gloved and fur-coated, in the neighbourhood of the
      luncheon-room when he arrived. It indeed still lacked a few minutes of the
      appointed hour when they thus met and went in together. They were
      fortunate enough to find a small table out on the balcony, sufficiently
      removed from any other to give privacy to their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      By tacit agreement, the General ordered the luncheon, speaking French to
      the waiter throughout. Divested of his imposing great-coat, he was seen to
      be a gentleman of meagre flesh as well as of small stature. He had the
      Roman nose, narrow forehead, bushing brows, and sharply-cut mouth and chin
      of a soldier grown old in the contemplation of portraits of the Duke of
      Wellington. His face and neck were of a dull reddish tint, which seemed at
      first sight uniformly distributed: one saw afterward that it approached
      pallor at the veined temples, and ripened into purple in minute patches on
      the cheeks and the tip of the pointed nose. Against this flushed skin, the
      closely-cropped hair and small, neatly-waxed moustache were very white
      indeed. It was a thin, lined, care-worn face, withal, which in repose, and
      particularly in profile, produced an effect of dignified and philosophical
      melancholy. The General's over-prominent light blue eyes upon occasion
      marred this effect, however, by glances of a bold, harsh character, which
      seemed to disclose unpleasant depths below the correct surface. His manner
      with the waiters was abrupt and sharp, but undoubtedly they served him
      very well&mdash;much better, in truth, than Thorpe had ever seen them
      serve anybody before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe observed his guest a good deal during the repast, and formed
      numerous conclusions about him. He ate with palpable relish of every dish,
      and he emptied his glass as promptly as his host could fill it. There was
      hardly a word of explanation as to the purpose of their meeting, until the
      coffee was brought, and they pushed back their chairs, crossed their legs,
      and lighted cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was lucky to catch you with my wire, at such short notice,&rdquo; Thorpe said
      then. &ldquo;I sent two, you know&mdash;to your chambers and your club. Which of
      them found you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chambers,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;I rarely dress till luncheon time. I read
      in bed. There's really nothing else to do. Idleness is the curse of my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been wondering if you'd like a little occupation&mdash;of a
      well-paid sort,&rdquo; said Thorpe slowly. He realized that it was high time to
      invent some pretext for his hurried summons of the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; responded the other, &ldquo;I should like anything that had money
      in it. And I should very much like occupation, too&mdash;if it were, of
      course, something that was&mdash;was suitable to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thorpe, meditatively. &ldquo;I've something in my mind&mdash;not at
      all definite yet&mdash;in fact, I don't think I can even outline it to you
      yet. But I'm sure it will suit you&mdash;that is, if I decide to go on
      with it&mdash;and there ought to be seven or eight hundred a year for you
      in it&mdash;for life, mind you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General's gaze, fastened strenuously upon Thorpe, shook a little.
      &ldquo;That will suit me very well,&rdquo; he declared, with feeling. &ldquo;Whatever I can
      do for it&rdquo;&mdash;he let the sentence end itself with a significant
      gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; commented the other, trifling with the spoon in his cup.
      &ldquo;But I want you to be open with me. I'm interested in you, and I want to
      be of use to you. All that I've said, I can do for you. But first, I'm
      curious to know everything that you can tell me about your circumstances.
      I'm right in assuming, I suppose, that you're&mdash;that you're not any
      too well-fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General helped himself to another little glass of brandy. His mood
      seemed to absorb the spirit of the liqueur. &ldquo;Fixed!&rdquo; he repeated with a
      peevish snap in his tone. &ldquo;I'm not 'fixed' at all, as you call it. Good
      God, sir! They no more care what becomes of me than they do about their
      old gloves. I gave them name and breeding and position&mdash;and
      everything&mdash;and they round on me like&mdash;like cuckoos.&rdquo; His pale,
      bulging eyes lifted their passionless veil for an instant as he spoke, and
      flashed with the predatory fierceness of a hawk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intuition helped Thorpe to guess whom &ldquo;they&rdquo; might mean. The temper
      visibly rising in the old man's mind was what he had hoped for. He
      proceeded with an informed caution. &ldquo;Don't be annoyed if I touch upon
      family matters,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's a part of what I must know, in order to
      help you. I believe you're a widower, aren't you, General?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other, after a quick upward glance, shook his head resentfully. &ldquo;Mrs.
      Kervick lives in Italy with HER son-in-law&mdash;and her daughter. He is a
      man of property&mdash;and also, apparently, a man of remarkable credulity
      and patience.&rdquo; He paused, to scan his companion's face. &ldquo;They divide him
      between them,&rdquo; he said then, from clenched teeth&mdash;&ldquo;and I&mdash;mind
      you&mdash;I made the match! He was a young fellow that I found&mdash;and I
      brought him home and introduced him&mdash;and I haven't so much as an
      Italian postage-stamp to show for it. But what interest can you possibly
      take in all this?&rdquo; The unamiable glance of his eyes was on the instant
      surcharged with suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many daughters have you?&rdquo; Thorpe ventured the enquiry with inward
      doubts as to its sagacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three,&rdquo; answered the General, briefly. It was evident that he was also
      busy thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask because I met one of them in the country over Sunday,&rdquo; Thorpe
      decided to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old soldier's eyes asked many questions in the moment of silence.
      &ldquo;Which one&mdash;Edith?&mdash;that is, Lady Cressage?&rdquo; he enquired. &ldquo;Of
      course&mdash;it would have been her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe nodded. &ldquo;She made a tremendous impression upon me,&rdquo; he observed,
      watching the father with intentness as he let the slow words fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well she might,&rdquo; the other replied, simply. &ldquo;She's supposed to be the
      most beautiful woman in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I guess she is,&rdquo; Thorpe assented, while the two men eyed each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the third sister unmarried?&rdquo; it occurred to him to ask. The tone of
      the question revealed its perfunctory character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;Beatrice&mdash;she's of no importance,&rdquo; the father replied. &ldquo;She
      goes in for writing, and all that&mdash;she's not a beauty, you know&mdash;she
      lives with an old lady in Scotland. The oldest daughter&mdash;Blanche&mdash;she
      has some good looks of her own, but she's a cat. And so you met Edith! May
      I ask where it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Hadlow House&mdash;Lord Plowden's place, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General's surprise at the announcement was undoubted. &ldquo;At Plowden's!&rdquo;
       he repeated, and added, as if half to himself, &ldquo;I thought that was all
      over with, long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you'd tell me about it,&rdquo; said Thorpe, daringly. &ldquo;I've made it
      plain to you, haven't I? I'm going to look out for you. And I want you to
      post me up, here, on some of the things that I don't understand. You
      remember that it was Plowden who introduced you to me, don't you? It was
      through him that you got on the Board. Well, certain things that I've seen
      lead me to suppose that he did that in order to please your daughter. Did
      you understand it that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's quite likely, in one sense,&rdquo; returned the General. He spoke with
      much deliberation now, weighing all his words. &ldquo;He may have thought it
      would please her; he may not have known how little my poor affairs
      concerned her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; pursued Thorpe, argumentatively, &ldquo;he had an object in
      pleasing her. Let me ask the question&mdash;did he want to marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most men want to marry her,&rdquo; was the father's non-committal response. His
      moustache lifted itself in the semblance of a smile, but the blue eyes
      above remained coldly vigilant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I guess that's so too,&rdquo; Thorpe remarked. He made a fleeting
      mental note that there was something about the General which impelled him
      to think and talk more like an American than ever. &ldquo;But was HE specially
      affected that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Kervick, judicially, &ldquo;I think it was understood that if he
      had been free to marry a penniless wife, he would have wished to marry
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; Thorpe began again, with a kind of diffident hesitation&mdash;&ldquo;do
      you happen to have formed an idea&mdash;supposing that had been the case&mdash;would
      she have accepted him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, there you have me,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Who
      can tell what women will accept, and what they will refuse? My daughter
      refused Lord Lingfield&mdash;and he is an Under-Secretary, and will be
      Earl Chobham, and a Cabinet Minister, and a rich man. After that, what are
      you to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of her as penniless,&rdquo; Thorpe remarked, with a casual air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six hundred a year,&rdquo; the father answered. &ldquo;We could have rubbed along
      after a fashion on it, if she had had any notions at all of taking my
      advice. I'm a man of the world, and I could have managed her affairs for
      her to her advantage, but she insisted upon going off by herself. She
      showed not the slightest consideration for me&mdash;but then I am
      accustomed to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe smiled reflectively, and the old gentleman read in this an
      encouragement to expand his grievances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my position,&rdquo; he continued, helping himself to still another tiny
      glass, &ldquo;I naturally say very little. It is not my form to make complaints
      and advertise my misfortunes. I daresay it's a fault. I know it kept me
      back in India&mdash;while ever so many whipper-snappers were promoted over
      my head&mdash;because I was of the proud and silent sort. It was a
      mistake, but it was my nature. I might have put by a comfortable provision
      for my old age, in those days, if I had been willing to push my claims,
      and worry the Staff into giving me what was my due. But that I declined to
      do&mdash;and when I was retired, there was nothing for me but the ration
      of bread and salt which they serve out to the old soldier who has been too
      modest. I served my Queen, sir, for forty years&mdash;and I should be
      ashamed to tell you the allowance she makes me in my old age. But I do not
      complain. My mouth is closed. I am an English gentleman and one of Her
      Majesty's soldiers. That's enough said, eh? Do you follow me? And about my
      family affairs, I'm not likely to talk to the first comer, eh? But to you
      I say it frankly&mdash;they've behaved badly, damned badly, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Kervick lives in Italy, at the cost of HER son-in-law. He has large
      estates in one of the healthiest and most beautiful parts; he has a
      palace, and more money than he knows what to do with&mdash;but it seems
      that he's not my son-in-law. I could do with Italy very well&mdash;but
      that doesn't enter into anyone's calculations. No! let the worn-out old
      soldier sell boot-laces on the kerb! That's the spirit of woman-kind. And
      my daughter Edith&mdash;does she care what becomes of me? Listen to me&mdash;I
      secured for her the very greatest marriage in England. She would have been
      Duchess of Glastonbury today if her husband had not played the fool and
      drowned himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that you say?&rdquo; put in Thorpe, swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was as good as suicide,&rdquo; insisted the General, with doggedness. His
      face had become a deeper red. &ldquo;They didn't hit it off together, and he
      left in a huff, and went yachting with his father, who was his own
      sailing-master&mdash;and, as might be expected, they were both drowned.
      The title would have gone to her son&mdash;but no, of course, she had no
      son&mdash;and so it passed to a stranger&mdash;an outsider that had been
      an usher in a school, or something of that sort. You can fancy what a blow
      this was to me. Instead of being the grandfather of a Duke, I have a
      childless widow thrust back upon my hands! Fine luck, eh? And then, to cap
      all, she takes her six hundred a year and goes off by herself, and gives
      me the cold shoulder completely. What is it Shakespeare says? 'How sharper
      than a serpent's teeth'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe brought his fist down upon the table with an emphasis which
      abruptly broke the quotation in half. He had been frowning moodily at his
      guest for some minutes, relighting his cigar more than once meanwhile. He
      had made a mental calculation of what the old man had had to drink, and
      had reassured himself as to his condition. His garrulity might have an
      alcoholic basis, but his wits were clear enough. It was time to take a new
      line with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to hear you abuse your daughter,&rdquo; he admonished him now,
      with a purpose glowing steadily in his firm glance. &ldquo;Damn it all, why
      shouldn't she go off by herself, and take care of her own money her own
      way? It's little enough, God knows, for such a lady as she is. Why should
      you expect her to support you out of it? No&mdash;sit still! Listen to
      me!&rdquo;&mdash;he stretched out his hand, and laid it with restraining
      heaviness upon the General's arm&mdash;&ldquo;you don't want to have any row
      with me. You can't afford it. Just think that over to yourself&mdash;you&mdash;can't
      afford&mdash;it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major-General Kervick's prominent blue eyes had bulged forth in rage till
      their appearance had disconcerted the other's gaze. They remained still
      too much in the foreground, as it were, and the angry scarlets and violets
      of the cheeks beneath them carried an unabated threat of apoplexy&mdash;but
      their owner, after a moment's silence, made a sign with his stiff white
      brows that the crisis was over. &ldquo;You must remember that&mdash;that I have
      a father's feelings,&rdquo; he gasped then, huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe nodded, with a nonchalance which was not wholly affected. He had
      learned what he wanted to know about this veteran. If he had the fierce
      meannesses of a famished old dog, he had also a dog's awe of a stick. It
      was almost too easy to terrorize him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I make allowances for all that,&rdquo; Thorpe began, vaguely. &ldquo;But it's
      important that you should understand me. I'm this sort of a man: whatever
      I set out to do, and put my strength into it, that I do! I kill every
      pheasant I fire at; Plowden will tell you that! It's a way I have. To
      those that help me, and are loyal to me, I'm the best friend in the world.
      To those that get in my way, or try to trip me up, I'm the devil&mdash;just
      plain devil. Now then&mdash;you're getting three hundred a year from my
      Company, that is to say from me, simply to oblige my friend Plowden. You
      don't do anything to earn this money; you're of no earthly use on the
      Board. If I chose, I could put you off at the end of the year as easily as
      I can blow out this match. But I propose not only to keep you on, but to
      make you independent. Why do I do that? You should ask yourself that
      question. It can't be on account of anything you can do for the Company.
      What else then? Why, first and foremost, because you are the father of
      your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you the kind of man I am,&rdquo; said the General, inflating his
      chest, and speaking with solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know the kind of man you are,&rdquo; Thorpe interrupted him, coolly. &ldquo;I
      want to talk now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was merely,&rdquo; Kervick ventured, in an injured tone, &ldquo;that I can be as
      loyal as any man alive to a true friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be the true friend, then,&rdquo; said Thorpe, with impatient
      finality. &ldquo;And now this is what I want to say. I'm going to be a very rich
      man. You're not to say so to anybody, mind you, until the thing speaks for
      itself. We're keeping dark for a few months, d'ye see?&mdash;lying low.
      Then, as I say, I shall be a very rich man. Well now, I wouldn't give a
      damn to be rich, unless I did with my money the things that I wanted to
      do, and got the things with it that I wanted to get. Whatever takes my
      fancy, that's what I'll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a moment, mentally to scrutinize a brand-new project which
      seemed, by some surreptitious agency, to have already taken his fancy. It
      was a curious project; there were attractive things about it, and
      objections to it suggested themselves as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may decide,&rdquo; he began speaking again, still revolving this hypothetical
      scheme in his thoughts&mdash;&ldquo;I may want to&mdash;well, here's what occurs
      to me as an off-chance. I take an interest in your daughter, d'ye see? and
      it seems a low-down sort of thing to me that she should be so poor. Well,
      then&mdash;I might say to you, here's two thousand a year, say, made over
      to you in your name, on the understanding that you turn over half of it,
      say, to her. She could take it from you, of course, as her father. You
      could say you made it out of the Company. Of course it might happen, later
      on, that I might like to have a gentle hint dropped to her, d'ye see, as
      to where it really came from. Mind, I don't say this is what is going to
      be done. It merely occurred to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After waiting for a moment for some comment, he added a second thought:
      &ldquo;You'd have to set about making friends with her, you know. In any case,
      you'd better begin at that at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General remained buried in reflection. He lighted a cigarette, and
      poured out for himself still another petit verre. His pursed lips and
      knitted brows were eloquent of intense mental activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you see any objections to it?&rdquo; demanded Thorpe, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not quite see the reasons for it,&rdquo; answered the other, slowly. &ldquo;What
      would you gain by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean&mdash;gain?&rdquo; put in the other, with peremptory
      intolerance of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Kervick spread his hands in a quick little gesture. These hands
      were withered, but remarkably well-kept. &ldquo;I suppose one doesn't do
      something for nothing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I see what I would gain, and what she
      would gain, but I confess I don't see what advantage you would get out of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, I daresay you don't,&rdquo; assented Thorpe, with sneering serenity. &ldquo;But
      what does that matter? You admit that you see what you would gain. That's
      enough, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The older man's veined temples twitched for an instant. He straightened
      himself in his chair, and looked hard at his companion. There was a
      glistening of moisture about his staring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It surely isn't necessary&mdash;among gentlemen&rdquo;&mdash;he began,
      cautiously picking his phrases&mdash;&ldquo;to have quite so much that's
      unpleasant, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;you're right&mdash;I didn't mean to be so rough,&rdquo; Thorpe
      declared, with spontaneous contrition. Upon the instant, however, he
      perceived the danger that advantage might be taken of his softness. &ldquo;I'm a
      plain-spoken man,&rdquo; he went on, with a hardening voice, &ldquo;and people must
      take me as they find me. All I said was, in substance, that I intended to
      be of service to you&mdash;and that that ought to interest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General seemed to have digested his pique. &ldquo;And what I was trying to
      say,&rdquo; he commented deferentially, &ldquo;was that I thought I saw ways of being
      of service to you. But that did not seem to interest you at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;service?&rdquo; Thorpe, upon consideration, consented to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know my daughter so much better than you do,&rdquo; explained the other; &ldquo;I
      know Plowden so much better; I am so much more familiar with the whole
      situation than you can possibly be&mdash;I wonder that you won't listen to
      my opinion. I don't suggest that you should be guided by it, but I think
      you should hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; Thorpe declared, readily enough. &ldquo;What IS your
      opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Kervick sipped daintily at his glass, and then gave an embarrassed
      little laugh. &ldquo;But I can't form what you might call an opinion,&rdquo; he
      protested, apologetically, &ldquo;till I understand a bit more clearly what it
      is you propose to yourself. You mustn't be annoyed if I return to that&mdash;'still
      harping on my daughter,' you know. If I MUST ask the question&mdash;is it
      your wish to marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe looked blankly at his companion, as if he were thinking of
      something else. When he spoke, it was with no trace of consciousness that
      the question had been unduly intimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't in the least be sure that I shall ever marry,&rdquo; he replied,
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;I may, and I may not. But&mdash;starting with that proviso&mdash;I
      suppose I haven't seen any other woman that I'd rather think about
      marrying than&mdash;than the lady we're speaking of. However, you see it's
      all in the air, so far as my plans go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the air be it,&rdquo; the soldier acquiesced, plausibly. &ldquo;Let us consider it
      as if it were in the air&mdash;a possible contingency. This is what I
      would say&mdash;My&mdash;'the lady we are speaking of' is by way of being
      a difficult lady&mdash;'uncertain, coy, and hard to please' as Scott says,
      you know&mdash;and it must be a very skilfully-dressed fly indeed which
      brings her to the surface. She's been hooked once, mind, and she has a
      horror of it. Her husband was the most frightful brute and ruffian, you
      know. I was strongly opposed to the marriage, but her mother carried it
      through. But&mdash;yes&mdash;about her&mdash;I think she is afraid to
      marry again. If she does ever consent, it will be because poverty has
      broken her nerve. If she is kept on six hundred a year, she may be
      starved, so to speak, into taking a husband. If she had sixteen hundred&mdash;either
      she would never marry at all, or she would be free to marry some handsome
      young pauper who caught her fancy. That would be particularly like her.
      You would be simply endowing some needy fellow, beside losing her for
      yourself. D'ye follow me? If you'll leave it to me, I can find a much
      better way than that&mdash;better for all of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; said Thorpe, and pondered the paternal statement. &ldquo;I see what you
      mean,&rdquo; he remarked at last. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General preserved silence for what seemed a long time, deferring to
      the reverie of his host. When finally he offered a diversion, in the form
      of a remark about the hour, Thorpe shook himself, and then ponderously
      rose to his feet. He took his hat and coat from the waiter, and made his
      way out without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the street door, confronting the waning foliage of the Embankment
      garden, Kervick was emboldened to recall to him the fact of his presence.
      &ldquo;Which way are you going?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; Thorpe answered absently. &ldquo;I think&mdash;I think I'll take
      a walk on the Embankment&mdash;by myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General could not repress all symptoms of uneasiness. &ldquo;But when am I
      to see you again?&rdquo; he enquired, with an effect of solicitude that defied
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See me?&rdquo; Thorpe spoke as if the suggestion took him by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are things to be settled, are there not?&rdquo; the other faltered, in
      distressed doubt as to the judicious tone to take. &ldquo;You spoke, you know,
      of&mdash;of some employment that&mdash;that would suit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe shook himself again, and seemed by an effort to recall his
      wandering attention. &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he said, with lethargic vagueness&mdash;&ldquo;I
      haven't thought it out yet. I'll let you know&mdash;within the week,
      probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the briefest of nods, he turned and crossed the road. Walking
      heavily, with rounded shoulders and hands plunged deep in his overcoat
      pockets, he went through the gateway, and chose a path at random. To the
      idlers on the garden benches who took note of him as he passed, he gave
      the impression of one struggling with nausea. To his own blurred
      consciousness, he could not say which stirred most vehemently within him,
      his loathing for the creature he had fed and bought, or his bitter
      self-disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General, standing with exaggerated exactness upon the doorstep, had
      followed with his bulging eyes the receding figure. He stood still
      regarding the gateway, mentally summarizing the events of the day, after
      the other had vanished. At last, nestling his chin comfortably into the
      fur of his collar, he smiled with self-satisfaction. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said
      to himself, &ldquo;there are always ways of making a cad feel that he is a cad,
      in the presence of a gentleman.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON a Sunday afternoon, early in February, Thorpe journeyed with his niece
      and nephew from Bern to Montreux.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people, with maps and a guide-book open, sat close together at
      the left side of the compartment. The girl from time to time rubbed the
      steam from the window with a napkin out of the lunch-basket. They both
      stared a good deal through this window, with frequent exclamations of
      petulance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it too provoking!&rdquo; cried the girl, turning to her uncle at last.
      &ldquo;This is where we are now&mdash;according to Baedeker: 'As the train
      proceeds we enjoy a view of the Simmen-Thal and Freiburg mountains to the
      left, the Moleson being conspicuous.' And look at it! For all one can see,
      we might as well be at Redhill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is pretty hard luck,&rdquo; Thorpe assented, passively glancing past her at
      the pale, neutral-tinted wall of mist which obscured the view. &ldquo;But hang
      it all&mdash;it must clear up some time. Just you have patience, and
      you'll see some Alps yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where we're going,&rdquo; the young man interposed, &ldquo;the head-porter told me it
      was always cloudier than anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think that can be so,&rdquo; Thorpe reasoned, languidly, from his
      corner. &ldquo;It's a great winter resort, I'm told, and it rather stands to
      reason, doesn't it? that people wouldn't flock there if it was so bad as
      all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The kind of people we've seen travelling in Switzerland,&rdquo; said the girl&mdash;&ldquo;they
      would do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe smiled, with tolerant good humour. &ldquo;Well, you can comfort yourself
      with the notion that you'll be coming again. The mountains'll stay here,
      all right,&rdquo; he assured her. The young people smiled back at him, and with
      this he rearranged his feet in a new posture on the opposite seat, lighted
      another cigar, and pillowed his head once more against the hard, red-plush
      cushion. Personally, he did not in the least resent the failure of the
      scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      For something more than three months, this purposeless pleasure-tour had
      been dragging him about from point to point, sleeping in strange beds,
      eating extraordinarily strange food, transacting the affairs of a
      sight-seer among people who spoke strange languages, until he was
      surfeited with the unusual. It had all been extremely interesting, of
      course, and deeply improving&mdash;but he was getting tired of talking to
      nobody but waiters, and still more so of having nothing to do which he
      could not as well leave undone if he chose. After a few days more of
      Switzerland&mdash;for they had already gazed with blank faces at this
      universal curtain of mist from such different points of view as Lucerne,
      Interlaken, and Thun&mdash;it was clear to him that they would, as he
      phrased it, to himself, make a break for home. Unless, indeed, something
      happened at Montreux. Ah, would anything happen at Montreux? For four days
      his mind had been automatically reverting to that question; it lurked
      continually in the background of his thoughts, now, as he smoked and idly
      ruminated, on his way southward through the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the rest of the prolonged trip had been without any specific motive,
      so far as he was concerned. The youngsters had planned all its routes and
      halts and details of time and connections, and he had gone along, with
      cheerful placidity, to look at the things they bade him observe, and to
      pay the bills. Perhaps in all things their tastes had not been his tastes.
      He would have liked more of Paris, he fancied, and less of the small Dutch
      and North German towns which they seemed to fancy so much. Still, the beer
      was good&mdash;and really their happiness, as a spectacle, had given him
      more satisfaction than a thousand miles of boulevards could have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked this niece and nephew of his more than he could ever have
      imagined himself liking any young people. They had been shy with him at
      the outset&mdash;and for the first week his experiment had been darkened
      by the belief that, between themselves, they did not deem him quite good
      enough. He had been wise enough, then, to have it out with the girl&mdash;she
      was the one to whom he felt it easiest to talk frankly&mdash;and had
      discovered, to his immense relief, that they conceived him to be regarding
      them as encumbrances. At breakfast next morning, with tactful geniality,
      he set everything right, and thereafter they were all extremely happy
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as he could judge, they were very superior young people, both
      intellectually and spiritually. The girl spoke French, and her brother
      German, with what seemed to him remarkable proficiency. Their young minds
      were the repositories of an astounding amount of information: they knew
      who Charles the Bold was; they pointed out to their uncle the distinction
      between Gothic and Romanesque arches; they explained what was the matter
      with the Anabaptists; they told him that the story of the Bishop and the
      rats at Bingen was a baseless myth, and that probably there had never been
      any such man as William Tell. Nor did they get all this out of the
      guide-books which they pored over with such zest. It was impossible not to
      see that they were familiar with large numbers of the subjects that these
      books discussed, and that the itinerary which they marked out had
      reference to desires and interests that they had cultivated for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia, upon even first sight, made a much pleasanter impression than her
      mother's hesitating description had prepared him for. As he came to know
      her well, he ceased to remember that there was a question in any mind as
      to her being a pretty girl. There was less colour in her face than he
      could have wished. Her smooth, pallid skin, almost waxen in texture, had a
      suggestion of delicate health which sometimes troubled him a little, but
      which appealed to the tenderness in his nature all the time. The face was
      unduly thin, perhaps, but this, and the wistful glance of the large grey
      eyes in repose, made up an effect that Thorpe found touched him a good
      deal. Even when she was in visibly high spirits, the look in these eyes
      seemed to him to be laying claim to his protection. She could be merry
      upon occasion, in a gentle and tranquil way, and as her self-confidence
      expanded under the shelter of their growing intimacy, she disclosed to her
      uncle plenty of initiative and individuality&mdash;but what he felt in her
      most was a peculiarly sweet and girlish trustfulness, which made him like
      himself more than he had ever done before. He could feel that he was at
      his very best&mdash;a hitherto unsuspected best&mdash;when Julia was
      about. He wanted to buy for her everything in the windows upon which she
      bestowed the most casual approving glance. It was a delight merely to look
      at her, and to meditate upon the felicity of being able to do things for
      so charming a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred made a less direct demand upon his uncle's admiration, but he was a
      very good fellow all round. He was big and fair and muscular, and nothing
      about him but his spectacles seemed in Thorpe's mind to be related to his
      choice of art as a profession. That so robust and hearty a young fellow
      should wish to put paint on a canvas with small brushes, was to the uncle
      an unaccountable thing. It was almost as if he had wanted to knit, or do
      embroidery. Of the idleness and impatience of discipline which his mother
      had seemed to allege against him, Thorpe failed to detect any signs. The
      young man was never very late in the morning, and, beside his tireless
      devotion to the task of hunting up old pictures in out-of-the-way places,
      did most of the steward's work of the party with intelligence and
      precision. He studied the time-tables, audited the hotel-bills, looked
      after the luggage, got up the street-maps of towns and the like, to such
      good purpose that they never lost a train, or a bag, or themselves. Truly,
      an excellent young man. Thorpe noted with especial satisfaction his fine,
      kindly big-brother attitude toward his sister Julia&mdash;and it was
      impossible for him to avoid the conviction that Louisa was a simpleton not
      to appreciate such children. They did not often allude to their mother;
      when they did, it was in language the terms of which seemed more
      affectionate than the tone&mdash;and Thorpe said often to himself that he
      did not blame them. It was not so much that they had outgrown their
      mother's point of view. They had never occupied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey, so far as Thorpe comprehended its character, had been shaped
      with about equal regard for Julia's interest in the romance of history,
      and Alfred's more technical and practical interest in art. Each had
      sufficient sympathy with the tastes of the other, however, to prevent any
      tendency to separation. They took their uncle one day to see where William
      the Silent was assassinated, and the next to observe how Rembrandt's
      theory of guild portrait-painting differed from Van der Helst's, with a
      common enthusiasm. He scrutinized with patient loyalty everything that
      they indicated to him, and not infrequently they appeared to like very
      much the comments he offered. These were chiefly of a sprightly nature,
      and when Julia laughed over them he felt that she was very near to him
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they saw Paris together&mdash;where Thorpe did relinquish some of the
      multiplied glories of the Louvre to sit in front of a cafe by the Opera
      House and see the funny people go past&mdash;and thence, by Bruges and
      Antwerp, to Holland, where nobody could have imagined there were as many
      pictures as Thorpe saw with his own weary eyes. There were wonderful old
      buildings at Lubeck for Julia's eyes to glisten over, and pictures at
      Berlin, Dresden, and Dusseldorf for Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assumption existed that the excursion into the Thuringenwald to see
      the memorials of Luther was especially for the uncle's benefit, and he
      tried solicitously to say or look nothing which might invalidate it. There
      were other places in Germany, from Mainz to Munich, which he remembered
      best by their different beers. They spent Christmas at Vienna, where Julia
      had heard that its observance was peculiarly insisted upon, and then they
      saw the Tyrol in its heaviest vesture of winter snows, and beautiful old
      Basle, where Alfred was crazier about Holbein than he had been at Munich
      over Brouwer. Thorpe looked very carefully at the paintings of both men,
      and felt strengthened in his hopes that when Alfred got a little older he
      would see that this picture business was not the thing for a young
      gentleman with prospects to go into.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at Basle that Thorpe received a letter from London which directly
      altered the plans of the party. He had had several other letters from
      London which had produced no such effect. Through Semple, he had followed
      in outline the unobtrusive campaign to secure a Special Settlement, and
      had learned that the Stock Exchange Committee, apparently without
      opposition, had granted one for the first week in February.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even this news, tremendously important as it was, did not prompt Thorpe to
      interfere with the children's projects. There was no longer any point in
      remaining away from London; there were, indeed, numerous reasons for a
      prompt return. But he was loth to deprive the youngsters of that descent
      into smiling, sunlit Italy upon which they had so fondly dwelt in fancy,
      and after all Semple could do all that was needful to be done for another
      month.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went to Basle, and here it was that another kind of letter came.
      It was in a strange hand, at once cramped and fluttering, which puzzled
      the recipient a good deal; it was a long time before even the signature
      unravelled itself. Then he forced himself to decipher it, sentence by
      sentence, with a fierce avidity. It was from General Kervick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Thorpe astonished his young companions by suggesting an
      alteration in their route. In a roundabout and tentative fashion&mdash;in
      which more suspicious observers must have detected something shamefaced&mdash;he
      mentioned that he had always heard a great deal about Montreux as a
      winter-resort. The fact that he called it Montroox raised in Julia's mind
      a fleeting wonder from whom it could be that he had heard so much about
      it, but it occurred to neither her nor her brother to question his entire
      good faith. Their uncle had displayed, hitherto, a most comforting freedom
      from discrimination among European towns; he had, indeed, assured them
      many times that they were all one to him. That he should suddenly turn up
      now with a favourite winter-resort of his own selection surprised them
      considerably, but, upon reflection, it also pleased them. He had humoured
      all their wishes with such unfailing and bountiful kindness, that it was a
      delight to learn that there was something he wanted to do. They could not
      finish their breakfast till the guide-book had been brought to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! How splendid!&rdquo; Julia had cried then. &ldquo;The Castle of Chillon is
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why of course!&rdquo; said Thorpe, complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed gayly at him for pretending that he had known this, and he as
      good-humouredly accepted their banter. He drew a serious long breath of
      relief, however, when their backs were turned. It had gone off much better
      than he had feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, on this Sunday afternoon, as the train made its sure-footed way
      across the mountains, the thought that he was actually to alight at
      Montreux at once fascinated and depressed him. He was annoyed with himself
      for suffering it to get such a hold upon his mind. What was there in it,
      anyway? There was a big hotel there, and he and his youngsters were to
      stop at it, and if he accidentally encountered a certain lady who was also
      stopping there&mdash;and of course the meeting would bear upon its face
      the stamp of pure chance&mdash;what of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      And if he did meet her, thus fortuitously&mdash;what would happen then? No
      doubt a lady of her social position met abroad great numbers of people
      that she had met at home. It would not in any way surprise her&mdash;this
      chance encounter of which he thought so much. Were there sufficient
      grounds for imagining that it would even interest her? He forced his mind
      up to this question, as it were, many times, and invariably it shied and
      evaded the leap.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been times, at Hadlow House, when Lady Cressage had seemed
      supremely indifferent to the fact of his existence, and there had been
      other times when it had appeared manifest that he pleased her&mdash;or
      better, perhaps, that she was willing to take note of how much she pleased
      him. It must have been apparent to her&mdash;this fact that she produced
      such an impression upon him. He reasoned this out satisfactorily to
      himself. These beautiful women, trained from childhood for the conquest of
      a rich husband, must have cultivated an extraordinary delicacy of
      consciousness, in such matters. They must have developed for themselves
      what might be called a sixth sense&mdash;a power of feeling in the air
      what the men about were thinking of them. More than once he had caught a
      glimmer of what he felt to be the operation of this sense, in the company
      of Lady Cressage. He could not say that it had been discernible in her
      glance, or her voice, or her manner, precisely, but he was sure that he
      had seen it, somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even assuming all this&mdash;admitting that in October, on a wet
      Sunday, in the tedium of a small country-house party, she had shown some
      momentary satisfaction in the idea that he was profoundly impressed by her&mdash;did
      it at all follow that in February, amid the distractions of a fashionable
      winter-resort, and probably surrounded by hosts of friends, she would pay
      any attention to him whatever? The abject fear that she might not even
      remember him&mdash;might not know him from Adam when he stood before her&mdash;skulked
      about in the labyrinths of his mind, but he drove it back whenever it
      showed itself. That would be too ignominious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people at the other side of the compartment, forever wiping the
      window with the napkin, and straining their eyes to see the invisible,
      diverted his unsettled attention. A new perception of how much he liked
      them and enjoyed having them with him, took hold of his thoughts. It had
      not occurred to him before, with any definiteness, that he would be
      insupportably lonely when the time came to part with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when he dwelt upon it, it made him feel sad and old.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said to himself at once, with decision, that there need be no parting
      at all. He would take a house without delay, and they should live with
      him. He could not doubt that this would be agreeable to them; it would
      solve every problem for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fancy sketched out the natural and legitimate extensions of this
      project. There would be, first of all, a house in town&mdash;a furnished
      house of a modest sort, having no pretension save to provide a cheerful
      temporary shelter for three people who liked one another. Here the new
      household would take shape, and get its right note of character.
      Apparently Louisa would not be urged to form part of this household. He
      said to himself with frankness that he didn't want her, and there had been
      nothing to indicate that her children would pine for her. She showed good
      sense when she said that her place was in the shop, and in her ancestral
      home over the shop. No doubt there would be a certain awkwardness, visible
      to others if not to themselves, about her living in one part of London and
      her children in another. But here also her good sense would come on;&mdash;and,
      besides, this furnished house in town would be a mere brief overture to
      the real thing&mdash;the noble country mansion he was going to have, with
      gardens and horses and hounds and artificial lakes and deer parks and
      everything. Quite within the year he would be able to realize this
      consummation of his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      How these nice young people would revel in such a place&mdash;and how they
      would worship him for having given it to them for a home! His heart warmed
      within him as he thought of this. He smiled affectionately at the picture
      Julia made, polishing the glass with vehement circular movements of her
      slight arm, and then grimacing in comic vexation at the deadly absence of
      landscape outside. Was there ever a sweeter or more lovable girl in this
      world? Would there have to be some older woman to manage the house, at the
      beginning? he wondered. He should like it immensely if that could be
      avoided. Julia looked fragile and inexperienced&mdash;but she would be
      twenty-one next month. Surely that was a mature enough age for the slight
      responsibility of presiding over servants who should be the best that
      money could buy. Many girls were married, and given households of their
      own to manage, when they were even younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reflection raised an obstacle against the smooth-flowing current of
      his thoughts. Supposing that Julia got the notion of marrying&mdash;how
      miserable that would make everything. Very likely she would never do any
      such thing; he had observed in her no shadow of a sign that a thought of
      matrimony had ever crossed her brain. Yet that was a subject upon which,
      of course, she could not be asked to give pledges, even to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe tried to take a liberal view of this matter. He argued to himself
      that there would be no objection at all to incorporating Julia's husband
      into the household, assuming that she went to the length of taking one,
      and that he was a good fellow. On this latter point, it was only the
      barest justice to Julia's tastes and judgment to take it for granted that
      he would be a good fellow. Yet the uncle felt uneasily that this would
      alter things for the worse. The family party, with that hypothetical young
      man in it, could never be quite so innocently and completely happy as&mdash;for
      instance&mdash;the family party in this compartment had been during these
      wonderful three months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically he rubbed the window beside him, and turned to look out with
      a certain fixedness&mdash;as if he might chance to catch a glimpse of the
      bridegroom with whom Julia would have it in her power to disturb the
      serenity of their prospective home. A steep white cliff, receding sullenly
      against the dim grey skyline; a farmhouse grotesquely low for its size,
      crouching under big shelving galleries heaped with snow; an opening in
      front, to the right, where vaguely there seemed to be a valley into which
      they would descend&mdash;he saw these things. They remained in his mind
      afterward as a part of something else that he saw, with his mental vision,
      at the same moment&mdash;a strikingly real and vivid presentment of Lady
      Cressage, attired as he had seen her in the saddle, her light hair blown
      about a little under her hat, a spot of colour in the exquisite cheek, the
      cold, impersonal dignity of a queen in the beautiful profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture was so actual for the instant that he uttered an involuntary
      exclamation&mdash;and then looked hastily round to see whether his
      companions had heard it. Seemingly they had not; he lolled again upon the
      comfortless cushion, and strove to conjure up once more the apparition.
      Nothing satisfactory came of the effort. Upon consideration, he grew
      uncertain as to whether he had seen anything at all. At the most it was a
      kind of half-dream which had visited him. He yawned at the thought, and
      lighted a fresh cigar. All at once, his mind had become too indolent to do
      any more thinking. A shapeless impression that there would be a good many
      things to think over later on flitted into his brain and out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how are the mountains using you, now?&rdquo; he called out to his niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I could shake them!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Listen to this: 'A view of
      singular beauty, embracing the greater part of the Lake of Geneva, and the
      surrounding mountains, is suddenly disclosed.' That's where we are now&mdash;or
      were a minute ago. You can see that there is some sort of valley in front
      of us&mdash;but that is all. If I could only see one mountain with snow on
      it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's all mountains and all snow, when you come to that,&rdquo; Thorpe
      insisted, with jocose perversity. &ldquo;You're on mountains yourself, all the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I mean,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I want to see something like the
      coloured pictures in the hotels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, probably it will be bright sunlight tomorrow,&rdquo; he said, for perhaps
      the twentieth time that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;that looks like water!&rdquo; said Alfred. &ldquo;See? just beyond the
      village. Yes, it is water. There's your Lake of Geneva, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn't the right colour,&rdquo; protested Julia, peering through the
      glass. &ldquo;It's precisely like everything else: it's of no colour at all. And
      they always paint it such a lovely blue! Really, uncle, the Swiss
      Government ought to return you your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait till you see it tomorrow&mdash;or next day,&rdquo; said the uncle,
      vaguely. He closed his eyes, and welcomed a drowsy mood. As he went off to
      sleep, the jolting racket of the train mellowed itself into a murmur of
      &ldquo;tomorrow or next day, tomorrow or next day,&rdquo; in his ears.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      FROM their windows, high up and at the front of the big hotel, Julia
      looked down upon the Lake of Geneva. She was in such haste to behold it
      that she had not so much as unbuttoned her gloves; she held her muff still
      in her hand. After one brief glance, she groaned aloud with vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the roadway, and the deserted miniature pier of Territet, both
      dishevelled under melting and mud-stained snow, there lay a patch of water&mdash;motionless,
      inconspicuous, of a faded drab colour&mdash;which at some small distance
      out vaguely ceased to look like water and, yet a little further out,
      became part and parcel of the dull grey mist. Save for the forlorn masts
      of a couple of fishing boats, beached under the shelter of the pier, there
      was no proof in sight that this was a lake at all. It was as uninspiring
      to the eye as a pool of drippings from umbrellas in a porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      While her uncle and brother occupied themselves with the luggage being
      brought up by the porters, she opened a window and stepped out upon the
      tiny balcony. A flaring sign on the inner framework of this balcony
      besought her in Swiss-French, in the interests of order, not to feed the
      birds. The injunction seemed meaningless to her until she perceived, over
      by the water, several gulls lazily wheeling about. They were almost as
      grey as the fog they circled in. Suddenly they seemed to perceive her in
      turn, and, swerving sharply, came floating toward the hotel, with harsh,
      almost menacing cries. She hurried in, and shut the window with decision.
      It seemed to her that the smile with which, as she turned, she was able to
      meet her uncle's look, was a product of true heroism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently this smile did not altogether delude him. &ldquo;Oh, now, you mustn't
      get down on your luck,&rdquo; he adjured her. &ldquo;We're going to be awfully cozy
      here. Have you seen your room? It's just there, in a little alley to the
      right of the door. They say it has an even finer view than these windows.
      Oh, you needn't laugh&mdash;this is the best view in the world, I'm told
      by those who know. And as a winter-resort, why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, look here!&rdquo; The interruption came from Alfred, who, having gone
      out on one of the balconies, put in his head now to summon them. &ldquo;Come
      here! Here's some fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed out to Thorpe the meaning of the inscription on the sign, and
      then pulled him forward to observe its practical defiance. A score of big
      gulls were flapping and dodging in excited confusion close before them,
      filling their ears with a painful clamour. Every now and again, one of the
      birds, recovering its senses in the hurly-burly, would make a curving
      swoop downward past the rows of windows below, and triumphantly catch in
      its beak something that had been thrown into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe, leaning over his railing, saw that a lady on a balcony one floor
      below, and some yards to the left, was feeding the birds. She laughed
      aloud as she did so, and said something over her shoulder to a companion
      who was not visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's pretty cool,&rdquo; he remarked to his niece, who had come to
      stand beside him. &ldquo;She's got the same sign down there that we've got. I
      can see it from here. Or perhaps she can't read French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or perhaps she isn't frightened of the hotel people,&rdquo; suggested the girl.
      She added, after a little, &ldquo;I think I'll feed them myself in the morning.
      I certainly shall if the sun comes out&mdash;as a sort of Thanksgiving
      festival, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle seemed not to hear her. He had been struck by the exceptional
      grace of the gestures with which the pieces of bread were flung forth. The
      hands and wrists of this lady were very white and shapely. The movements
      which she made with them, all unaware of observation as she was, and
      viewed as he viewed them from above, were singularly beautiful in their
      unconstraint. It was in its way like watching some remarkable fine
      dancing, he thought. He could not see much of her face, from his perch,
      but she was tall and fashionably clad. There was a loose covering of black
      lace thrown over her head, but once, as she turned, he could see that her
      hair was red. Even in this fleeting glimpse, the unusual tint attracted
      his attention: there was a brilliancy as of fire in it. Somehow it seemed
      to make a claim upon his memory. He continued to stare down at the
      stranger with an indefinable sense that he knew something about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly another figure appeared upon the balcony&mdash;and in a flash he
      comprehended everything. These idiotic, fighting gluttons of gulls had
      actually pointed out to him the object of his search. It was Lady Cressage
      who stood in the doorway, there just below him&mdash;and her companion,
      the red-haired lady who laughed hotel-rules to scorn, was the American
      heiress who had crossed the ocean in his ship, and whom he had met later
      on at Hadlow. What was her name&mdash;Martin? No&mdash;Madden. He
      confronted the swift impression that there was something odd about these
      two women being together. At Hadlow he had imagined that they did not like
      each other. Then he reflected as swiftly that women probably had their own
      rules about such matters. He seemed to have heard, or read, perhaps, that
      females liked and disliked each other with the most capricious
      alternations and on the least tangible of grounds. At all events, here
      they were together now. That was quite enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies had gone in, and closed their window. The sophisticated
      birds, with a few ungrateful croaks of remonstrance, had drifted away
      again to the water. His niece had disappeared from his elbow. Still Thorpe
      remained with his arms folded on the railing, his eyes fixed on the vacant
      balcony, below to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last he went inside, the young people were waiting for him with
      the project of a stroll before dinner. The light was failing, but there
      was plenty of time. They had ascertained the direction in which Chillon
      lay; a servant had assured them that it was only a few minutes' walk, and
      Alfred was almost certain that he had seen it from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe assented with a certain listlessness, which they had never noted in
      his manner before, but when Julia begged him not to stir if he were in the
      slightest degree tired, he replied honestly enough that he would do
      anything rather than be left alone. Then, of course, they said, there
      should be no walk, but to this he would not listen. The party trooped
      downstairs, accordingly, and out into the street. The walking was vile,
      but, as Julia had long ago said, if they were to be deterred by slush they
      would never get anywhere or see anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      It proved to be too late and too dark to either enter the castle or get
      much of an idea of its exterior. Returning, they paused again to look into
      the lighted window of the nice little book-shop. The numerous photographs
      of what they were entitled to behold from the windows of their hotel
      seemed more convincing than photographs usually were. As the young people
      inspected them, they became reassured. It was not credible that such a
      noble vista would forever deny itself to such earnest pilgrims. When their
      uncle introduced this time his ancient formula about the certainty of
      brilliant sunshine in the morning, they somehow felt like believing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I really think it must change,&rdquo; Julia declared, with her
      fascinated glance upon the photographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred looked at his watch. &ldquo;We'd better get along to the hotel, hadn't
      we?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way&rdquo;&mdash;Thorpe began, with a certain uneasiness of manner&mdash;&ldquo;speaking
      of dinner, wouldn't you like to dine at the big table d'hote, instead of
      up in our sitting-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're tired of our dining alone&mdash;by all means,&rdquo; answered Julia,
      readily. There was obvious surprise, however, in both her look and tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired nothing!&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I like it better than anything else in
      the world. But what I mean is&mdash;I was thinking, seeing that this is
      such a great winter-resort, and all the swagger people of Europe come here&mdash;that
      probably you youngsters would enjoy seeing the crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julia's glance, full of affectionate appreciation, showed how wholly she
      divined his spirit of self-sacrifice. &ldquo;We wouldn't care in the least for
      it,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;We enjoy being a little party by ourselves every whit
      as much as you do&mdash;and we both hate the people you get at table
      d'hotes&mdash;and besides, for that matter, if there are any real swells
      here, you may be sure they dine in their own rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo; Thorpe exclaimed swiftly, in palpable self-rebuke. &ldquo;I
      don't know what I could have been thinking of. Of course they would dine
      in their rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, Thorpe rose earlier than ever&mdash;with the impression of a
      peculiarly restless and uncomfortable night behind him. It was not until
      he had shaved and dressed that he noted the altered character of the air
      outside. Although it was not fully daylight yet, he could see the outlines
      of the trees and vinerows on the big, snow-clad hill, which monopolized
      the prospect from his window, all sharp and clear cut, as if he were
      looking at them through an opera-glass. He went at once to the
      sitting-room, and thrust the curtains aside from one of the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      A miracle had been wrought in the night. The sky overhead was serenely
      cloudless; the lake beneath, stirring softly under some faint passing
      breeze, revealed its full breadth with crystalline distinctness. Between
      sky and water there stretched across the picture a broad, looming,
      dimly-defined band of shadow, marked here and there at the top by little
      slanting patches of an intensely glowing white. He looked at this darkling
      middle distance for a moment or two without comprehension. Then he turned
      and hurriedly moved to the door of Julia's room and beat upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; he called through the panels. &ldquo;Here's your sunrise&mdash;here's
      your Alpine view. Go to your window and see it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A clear voice, not unmirthful, replied: &ldquo;I've been watching it for half an
      hour, thanks. Isn't it glorious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was more fortunate at the opposite door, for Alfred was still asleep.
      The young man, upon hearing the news, however, made a toilet of unexampled
      brevity, and came breathlessly forth. Thorpe followed him to the balcony,
      where he stood collarless and uncombed, with the fresh morning breeze
      blowing his hair awry, his lips parted, his eyes staring with what the
      uncle felt to be a painful fixedness before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had seen many mountains in many lands. They did not interest him
      very much. He thought, however, that he could see now why people who had
      no mountains of their own should get excited about Switzerland. He
      understood a number of these sentimental things now, for that matter,
      which had been Greek to him three months before. Unreceptive as his
      philistinism may have seemed to these delightful youngsters, it was
      apparent enough to him that they had taught him a great deal. If he could
      not hope to share their ever-bubbling raptures and enthusiasms, at least
      he had come to comprehend them after a fashion, and even to discern
      sometimes what it was that stirred them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched his nephew now&mdash;having first assured himself by a
      comprehensive downward glance that no other windows of the hotel-front
      were open. The young man seemed tremendously moved, far too much so to
      talk. Thorpe ventured once some remarks about the Mexican mountains, which
      were ever so much bigger, as he remembered them, but Alfred paid no heed.
      He continued to gaze across the lake, watching in rapt silence one facet
      after another catch the light, and stand out from the murky gloom,
      radiantly white, till at last the whole horizon was a mass of shining
      minarets and domes, and the sun fell full on his face. Then, with a
      long-drawn sigh, he turned, re-entered the room, and threw himself into a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too good!&rdquo; he declared, with a half-groan. &ldquo;I didn't know it would
      be like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why nothing's too good for us, man,&rdquo; his uncle told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THAT is,&rdquo; said the boy, simply, and Thorpe, after staring for a moment,
      smiled and rang the bell for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Julia made her appearance, a few minutes later, the table was already
      laid, and the waiter was coming in with the coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought we'd hurry up breakfast,&rdquo; her uncle explained, after she had
      kissed him and thanked him for the sunrise he had so successfully
      predicted&mdash;&ldquo;because I knew you'd both be crazy to get out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not over-estimated their eagerness, which was so great, indeed,
      that they failed to note the excessive tranquility of his own demeanour.
      He ate with such unusual deliberation, on this exciting morning, that they
      found themselves at the end of their repast when, apparently, he had but
      made a beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you mustn't wait for me at all,&rdquo; he announced to them then. &ldquo;I'm a
      little tired this morning&mdash;and I think I'd just like to lie around
      and smoke, and perhaps read one of your novels. But you two must get your
      things on and lose no time in getting out. This is the very best time of
      day, you know&mdash;for Alpine scenery. I'd hate to have you miss any of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under his kindly if somewhat strenuous insistence, they went to their
      rooms to prepare for an immediate excursion. He was so anxious to have
      them see all there was to be seen that, when Julia returned, properly
      cloaked and befurred, and stood waiting at the window, he scolded a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is that boy doing?&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a latent snarl in
      his tone which was novel to her ear. &ldquo;He'll keep you here till noon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's shaving, I think. He won't be long,&rdquo; she replied, with great
      gentleness. After a moment's pause, she turned from the window and came
      gayly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgot: I was going to feed the birds. There are several of them
      out there now.&rdquo; As she spoke, she busily broke up some of the rolls on the
      table. Her face was bright with the pleasure of the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't much mind, Julia,&rdquo; her uncle began, with almost pleading
      intonations, &ldquo;I rather think I wouldn't feed those birds. The rule is
      there before our eyes, you know&mdash;and it's always been my idea that if
      you're at a hotel it's the correct thing to abide by its rules. It's just
      an idea of mine&mdash;and I daresay, if you think about it, you'll feel
      the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl freed the last remaining bread-crumb from her gloves. &ldquo;Why, of
      course, uncle,&rdquo; she said, with promptitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although there was no hint of protest in her tone or manner, he felt
      impelled to soften still further this solitary demonstration of his
      authority. &ldquo;You see I've been all round the world, my little girl,&rdquo; he
      explained, haltingly, &ldquo;and when a man's done that, and knocked about
      everywhere, he's apt to get finicking and notional about trifles every
      once in a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're less so than anybody I ever knew,&rdquo; she generously interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no I'm not. You don't know me well enough yet; that's what's the
      matter. And you see, Julia&mdash;another thing just because you saw that
      lady throwing out bread, that aint a very good reason why you should do
      it. You don't know what kind of a person she may be. Girls have got to be
      so frightfully careful about all that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julia offered a constrained little laugh in comment. &ldquo;Oh, you don't know
      how careful I can be,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're not annoyed?&rdquo; he entreated her&mdash;and for answer she came
      behind him, and rested an arm on his shoulder, and patted it. He stroked
      her hand with his own. &ldquo;That's something like the nicest niece in the
      world!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last she and her brother had gone, he made short work of his
      breakfast, and drank his coffee at a gulp. A restless activity suddenly
      informed his movements. He lit a cigar, and began pacing up and down the
      room, biting his lips in preoccupation as he went. After a little, he
      opened a window, and ventured cautiously as far out on the balcony as was
      necessary to obtain a view of the street below. Eventually, he identified
      his nephew and niece among the pedestrians beneath him, and he kept them
      in sight till, after more than one tiresome halt at a shop window, they
      disappeared round a bend in the road. Then he turned and came back into
      the room with the buoyant air of a man whose affairs are prospering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled genially to himself as he gathered from the table in one
      capacious hand all the pieces of bread his beloved niece had broken up,
      and advanced again to the open window. Waiting here till one of the dingy
      gulls moving aimlessly about was headed toward him, he tossed out a
      fragment. The bird dashed at it with a scream, and on the instant the
      whole squawking flock were on wing. He suffered the hubbub to proceed
      unappeased for a little while he kept a watchful though furtive eye on
      that balcony to the left, below. Unhappily he could not get out far enough
      to see whether the inner curtains of its window were drawn. He threw
      another bit of bread, and then looked at his watch. It was a few minutes
      past nine. Surely people travelling to see scenery would be up by this
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strategy of issuing just enough bread to keep the feathered concourse
      in motion commended itself to his mind. As a precautionary measure, he
      took all the rolls remaining on the table, and put them in the drawer of a
      desk by the window. It even occurred to him to ring for more bread, but
      upon consideration that seemed too daring. The waiter would be
      sufficiently surprised at the party's appetites as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, his plan of campaign suddenly yielded a victory. Lady
      Cressage appeared on her balcony, clad in some charming sort of morning
      gown, and bareheaded. She had nothing in her hands, and seemed indifferent
      to the birds, but when Thorpe flung forth a handful of fragments into the
      centre of their whirling flock, she looked up at him. It was the anxious
      instant, and he ventured upon what he hoped was a decorous compromise
      between a bow and a look of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in no haste to answer either. He could see rather than hear that
      she said something to her invisible companion within, the while she
      glanced serenely in the general direction of his balcony. It seemed to him
      that the answer to her remark, whatever it was, must have exerted a direct
      influence upon his destiny, for Lady Cressage all at once focussed her
      vague regard upon him, and nodded with a reasonably gracious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's wonderful luck to find you here,&rdquo; he called down to her. Having
      played their part, he wished now that the birds were at Jericho. Their
      obstreperous racket made conversation very difficult. Apparently she made
      him an answer, but he could catch nothing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm here with my niece and nephew,&rdquo; he shouted down. &ldquo;I don't hear what
      you say. May I come down and pay my respects&mdash;later on? What is your
      number, and when may I come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These questions, as he flashed them in review through his mind, seemed to
      be all right from the most exacting social point of view. Doubtless it was
      equally all right that, before replying, she should consult her companion,
      as she did at some length. Then she replied&mdash;and he had no difficulty
      now in hearing her above the birds&mdash;that it would be very nice of him
      to come, say, in an hour's time. She told him the number&mdash;and then
      almost abruptly went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe, during this hour that ensued, smoked with volcanic energy. He
      tried to interest himself in one after another of half a dozen Tauchnitz
      novels his niece carried about, with a preposterous absence of success. He
      strove to arrange in some kind of sequence the things that he should say,
      when this momentous interview should begin, but he could think of nothing
      which did not sound silly. It would be all right, he argued to himself in
      the face of this present mental barrenness; he always talked well enough
      on the spur of the moment, when the time came&mdash;and still was not
      reassured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered if both ladies would be there to receive him, and decided that
      they would probably regard that as indispensable to the proprieties. In
      that case, their conversation would necessarily be of the most casual and
      general character. He would tell them a good deal about his niece, he
      foresaw. A man travelling about with a niece&mdash;and such a delightfully
      lady-like and engaging little niece&mdash;would take on some added
      interest and dignity, he perceived, in the eyes of ladies travelling
      alone. He essayed to estimate just how much they would probably like
      Julia. Of course he would say nothing about her mother and the book-shop;
      a vague allusion to a widowed sister would be ample on that head. But
      there could be confident references to Cheltenham; he knew from what Julia
      had said that it suggested the most satisfactory social guarantees, if
      taken strictly by itself. And then so much would depend upon Julia
      herself! If she succeeded in striking up a friendship with them&mdash;ah,
      then everything would be all right. Perhaps they would take a fancy to
      Alfred too! He was a boy, of course, but conceivably the fact that he
      wanted to paint, and knew about pictures, would appeal to them. He seemed
      to have heard somewhere that artists were the very devil among women.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the weary time of waiting had worn itself out, somehow, and, after
      a final polishing before his glass, he went down, and found his right
      corridor, and knocked at the door. A pleasant voice bade him enter, and,
      hat and gloves in hand, he went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had imagined, both ladies were present. He had not been prepared,
      however, for the fact that it was the American who played the part of
      hostess. It was she who received him, and invited him to sit down, and
      generally made him free of the apartment. When he shook hands with Lady
      Cressage, there was somehow an effect of the incidental in the ceremony,
      as if she were also a guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could have been simpler or more pleasing than the little visit
      turned out to be. Miss Madden had suddenly grown tired of the snowless and
      dripping English winter, and had as promptly decided to come to
      Switzerland, where the drifts ought to be high enough, and the frosts
      searching enough, in all conscience. They had selected Territet, because
      it was familiar to her, and because it was on the way to Martigny and
      Brieg, and she had had a notion of crossing either the Simplon or the St.
      Bernard in winter. As she found now, the St. Bernard was quite
      impracticable, but admittedly a post road was kept open over the Simplon.
      It was said now that she would not be allowed to proceed by this, but it
      often happened that she did the things that she was not allowed to do. The
      hotel-people at both Brieg and Berisal had written refusing to let their
      horses attempt the Simplon journey, and they were of course quite within
      their rights, but there were other horses in Switzerland. One surely could
      buy horses&mdash;and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe also had his turn at autobiography. He told rather whimsically of
      his three months' experiences at the tail of the juvenile whirligigs, and
      his auditors listened to them with mild smiles. He ventured upon numerous
      glowing parentheses about Julia, and they at least did not say that they
      did not want to know her. They heard with politeness, too, what he could
      contrive to drag in about his artist-nephew, and said it must be very
      pleasant for him to have such nice company. At least Miss Madden said
      this: her companion, as he thought it over afterward, seemed hardly to
      have said anything at all. She answered the few remarks which he found it
      possible to direct to her, but the responses took no hold upon his memory.
      He fancied that she was bored, or unhappy, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in the midst of commonplaces which, to his apprehension, were
      verging upon flatness, a bold inspiration disclosed itself&mdash;as
      splendid as the Dent du Midi revealing its glaciers above the mounting
      sunrise&mdash;in his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should all be charmed if you would come up and dine with us tonight,&rdquo;
       he said, under the abrupt impulsion of this idea. &ldquo;It's been such an age
      since we wanderers have had the privilege of company at our table!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The felicity of these phrases from his lips attracted his admiring
      attention, even while he waited in suspense for an answer to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies exchanged a look. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Madden, after the slightest
      of pauses, &ldquo;we shall be very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shortly thereafter Thorpe took his leave, and went downstairs and out. He
      wandered about till luncheon time, observing the mountains across the lake
      from various standpoints, and, as it were, with new eyes. He was
      interested in them in a curious new fashion; they seemed to say things to
      him. His lip curled once at the conceit that he was one of the Alps
      himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT did not happen until three days later that Thorpe's opportunity to
      speak alone with Lady Cressage came.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this brief period, the two parties seemed to have become fused in a
      remarkable intimacy. This was clearly due to the presence of the young
      people, and Thorpe congratulated himself many times each day upon the
      striking prescience he had shown in bringing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the ladies unaffectedly liked Julia; so much so that they seemed
      unwilling to make any plans which did not include her. Then it was only a
      matter of course that where she went her brother should go&mdash;and a
      further logical step quite naturally brought in their willing uncle. If he
      had planned everything, and now was ordering everything, it could not have
      gone more to his liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain side speculations lent a savour to the satisfaction with which he
      viewed this state of affairs. He found many little signs to confirm the
      suspicion that the two ladies had been the readier to make much of Julia
      because they were not overkeen about each other's society. The bright,
      sweet-natured girl had come as a welcome diversion to a couple who in
      seclusion did battle with tendencies to yawn. He was not quite convinced,
      for that matter, that the American lady always went to that trouble. She
      seemed to his observation a wilful sort of person, who would not be
      restrained by small ordinary considerations from doing the things she
      wanted to do. Her relations with her companion afforded him food for much
      thought. Without any overt demonstrations, she produced the effect of
      ordering Lady Cressage about. This, so far as it went, tended to prejudice
      him against her. On the other hand, however, she was so good to Julia, in
      a peculiarly frank and buoyant way which fascinated the girl, that he
      could not but like her. And she was very good to Alfred too.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, indeed, he perceived, a great deal of individuality about the
      friendship which had sprung up between Miss Madden and his nephew. She was
      years his senior&mdash;he settled it with himself that the American could
      not be less than seven-and-twenty,&mdash;yet Alfred stole covert glances
      of admiration at her, and seemed to think of nothing but opportunities for
      being in her company as if&mdash;as if&mdash;Thorpe hardly liked to
      complete the comparison in his own thoughts. Alfred, of course, said it
      was all on account of her wonderful hair; he rather went out of his way to
      dilate upon the enthusiasm her &ldquo;colour scheme&rdquo;&mdash;whatever that might
      mean&mdash;excited in him as an artist. The uncle had moments of profound
      skepticism about this&mdash;moments when he uneasily wondered whether it
      was not going to be his duty to speak to the young man. For the most part,
      however, he extracted reassurance from Miss Madden's demeanour toward the
      lad. She knew, it seemed, a vast deal about pictures; at least she was
      able to talk a vast deal about them, and she did it in such a calmly
      dogmatic fashion, laying down the law always, that she put Alfred in the
      position of listening as a pupil might listen to a master. The humility
      with which his nephew accepted this position annoyed Thorpe upon occasion,
      but he reasoned that it was a fault on the right side. Very likely it
      would help to keep the fact of the lady's seniority more clearly before
      the youngster's mind, and that would be so much gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these apprehensions, after all, were scarcely to be counted in the
      balance against the sense of achieved happiness with which these halcyon
      days kept Thorpe filled. The initiatory dinner had gone off perfectly. He
      could have wished, indeed, that Julia had a smarter frock, and more rings,
      when he saw the imposing costumes and jewelled throats and hands of his
      guests&mdash;but she was a young girl, by comparison, he reflected, and
      there could be no doubt that they found her charming. As for Alfred, he
      was notably fine-looking in his evening-clothes&mdash;infinitely more like
      the son of a nobleman, the gratified uncle kept saying to himself, than
      that big dullard, the Honourable Balder. It filled him with a new pleasure
      to remember that Alfred had visiting cards presenting his name as
      D'Aubigny, which everybody of education knew was what the degenerate
      Dabney really stood for. The lad and his sister had united upon this
      excellent change long ago at Cheltenham, and oddly enough they had
      confessed it to their uncle, at the beginning of the trip, with a show of
      trepidation, as if they feared his anger. With radiant gayety he had
      relieved their minds by showing them his card, with &ldquo;Mr. Stormont Thorpe&rdquo;
       alone upon it. At the dinner table, in the proudest moment of his life, he
      had made himself prouder still by thinking how distinguished an appearance
      his and Alfred's cards would make together in the apartment below next
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But next day, the relations between the two parties had already become too
      informal for cards. Julia went down to see them; they came up to see
      Julia. Then they all went for a long walk, with luncheon at Vevey, and
      before evening Alfred was talking confidently of painting Miss Madden.
      Next day they went by train to St. Maurice, and, returning after dark,
      dined without ceremony together. This third day&mdash;the weather still
      remaining bright&mdash;they had ascended by the funicular road to Glion,
      and walked on among the swarming luegers, up to Caux. Here, after
      luncheon, they had wandered about for a time, regarding the panorama of
      lake and mountains. Now, as the homeward descent began, chance led the two
      young people and Miss Madden on ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe found himself walking beside Lady Cressage. He had upon his arm her
      outer wrap, which she said she would put on presently. To look at the view
      he must glance past her face: the profile, under the graceful fur cap, was
      so enriched by glowing colour that it was, to his thought, as if she were
      blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How little I thought, a few months ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we should be
      mountaineering together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no one knows a day ahead,&rdquo; she responded, vaguely. &ldquo;I had probably
      less notion of coming to Switzerland then than you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't come regularly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen either Germany or Switzerland before. I have scarcely
      been out of England before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why now&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, to think briefly upon his words&mdash;&ldquo;I took
      it for granted you were showing Miss Madden around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It 's quite the other way about,&rdquo; she answered, with a cold little laugh.
      &ldquo;It is she who is showing me around. It is her tour. I am the chaperone.&rdquo;
       Thorpe dwelt upon the word in his mind. He understood what it meant only
      in a way, but he was luminously clear as to the bitterness of the tone in
      which it had been uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;it didn't seem as if it were altogether&mdash;what I might call&mdash;YOUR
      tour,&rdquo; he ventured. They had seen much of each other these past few days,
      but it was still hard for him to make sure whether their freedom of
      intercourse had been enlarged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slight shrug of the shoulders with which, in silence, she commented
      upon his remark, embarrassed him. For a moment he said nothing. He went on
      then with a renewed consciousness of risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't be annoyed with me,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;I've been travelling with
      that dear little niece of mine and her brother, so long, that I've got
      into a habit of watching to notice if the faces I see round me are happy.
      And when they're not, then I have a kind of fatherly notion of
      interfering, and seeing what's wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled faintly at this, but when he added, upon doubtful inspiration&mdash;&ldquo;By
      the way, speaking of fathers, I didn't know at Hadlow that you were the
      daughter of one of my Directors&rdquo;&mdash;this smile froze upon the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Dent du Midi is more impressive from the hotel, don't you think?&rdquo; she
      remarked, &ldquo;than it is from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon consideration, he resolved to go forward. &ldquo;I have taken a great
      interest in General Kervick,&rdquo; he said, almost defiantly. &ldquo;I am seeing to
      it that he has a comfortable income&mdash;an income suitable to a
      gentleman of his position&mdash;for the rest of his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be very glad of it,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I hoped that you would be glad of it too,&rdquo; he told her, bluntly. A
      curious sense of reliance upon his superiority in years had come to him.
      If he could make his air elderly and paternal enough, it seemed likely
      that she would defer to it. &ldquo;I'm talking to you as I would to my niece,
      you know,&rdquo; he added, plausibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head to make a fleeting survey of his face, as if the point
      of view took her by surprise. &ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are
      providing an income for my father, because you wish to speak to me like an
      uncle. Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, somewhat disconsolately. &ldquo;No&mdash;that isn't it,&rdquo; he said,
      and laughed again. &ldquo;I couldn't tell, you know, that you wouldn't want to
      talk about your father.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, there's no reason in the world for not
      talking of him,&rdquo; she made haste to declare. &ldquo;And if he's got something
      good in the City, I'm sure I'm as glad as anyone. He is the sort that
      ought always to have a good deal of money. I mean, it will bring out his
      more amiable qualities. He does not shine much in adversity&mdash;any more
      than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe felt keenly that there were fine things to be said here&mdash;but
      he had confidence in nothing that came to his tongue. &ldquo;I've been a poor
      man all my life&mdash;till now,&rdquo; was his eventual remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't tell me that you have been very happy in your poverty,&rdquo; she
      adjured him, with the dim flicker of a returning smile. &ldquo;Very likely there
      are people who are so constituted, but they are not my kind. I don't want
      to hear them tell about it. To me poverty is the horror&mdash;the
      unmentionable horror!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There never was a day that I didn't feel THAT!&rdquo; Thorpe put fervour into
      his voice. &ldquo;I was never reconciled to it for a minute. I never ceased
      swearing to myself that I'd pull myself out of it. And that's what makes
      me sort of soft-hearted now toward those&mdash;toward those who haven't
      pulled themselves out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your niece says you are soft-hearted beyond example,&rdquo; remarked Lady
      Cressage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who could help being, to such a sweet little girl as she is?&rdquo; demanded
      the uncle, fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very nice,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;If one may say such a thing, I fancy
      these three months with her have had an appreciable effect upon you. I'm
      sure I note a difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just what I've been saying to myself!&rdquo; he told her. He was visibly
      delighted with this corroboration. &ldquo;I've been alone practically all my
      life. I had no friends to speak of&mdash;I had no fit company&mdash;I
      hadn't anything but the determination to climb out of the hole. Well, I've
      done that&mdash;and I've got among the kind of people that I naturally
      like. But then there came the question of whether they would like me. I
      tell you frankly, that was what was worrying the heart out of me when I
      first met you. I like to be confessing it to you now&mdash;but you
      frightened me within an inch of my life. Well now, you see, I'm not scared
      of you at all. And of course it's because Julia's been putting me through
      a course of sprouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The figure was lost upon Lady Cressage, but the spirit of the remarks
      seemed not unpleasant to her. &ldquo;I'm sure you're full of kindness,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;You must forget that I snapped at you&mdash;about papa.&rdquo; &ldquo;All I
      remember about that is,&rdquo; he began, his eye lighting up with the thought
      that this time the opportunity should not pass unimproved, &ldquo;that you said
      he didn't shine much in adversity&mdash;-any more than you did. Now on
      that last point I disagree with you, straight. There wouldn't be any place
      in which you wouldn't shine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the way one talks to one's niece?&rdquo; she asked him, almost
      listlessly. &ldquo;Such flattery must surely be bad for the young.&rdquo; Her words
      were sprightly enough, but her face had clouded over. She had no heart for
      the banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&rdquo;&mdash;he half-groaned. &ldquo;I only wish I knew what was the right way to
      talk to you. The real thing is that I see you're unhappy&mdash;and that
      gets on my nerve&mdash;and I should like to ask you if there wasn't
      something I could do&mdash;and ask it in such a way that you'd have to
      admit there was&mdash;and I don't know enough to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a wan smile for thanks. &ldquo;But of course there is nothing,&rdquo; she
      replied, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there must be!&rdquo; he insisted. He had no longer any clear notions as to
      where his tongue might not lead him. &ldquo;There must be! You said I might talk
      to you as I would to Julia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm going to, anyway,&rdquo; he went on stoutly, ignoring the note of
      definite dissent in her interruption. &ldquo;You ARE unhappy! You spoke about
      being a chaperone. Well now, to speak plainly, if it isn't entirely
      pleasant for you with Miss Madden&mdash;why wouldn't you be a chaperone
      for Julia? I must be going to London very soon&mdash;but she can stay
      here, or go to Egypt, or wherever she likes&mdash;and of course you would
      do everything, and have everything&mdash;whatever you liked, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The conversation is getting upon rather impossible grounds, I'm afraid,&rdquo;
       she said, and then bit her lips together. Halting, she frowned a little in
      the effort of considering her further words, but there was nothing severe
      in the glance which she lifted to him as she began to speak. &ldquo;Let us walk
      on. I must tell you that you misconceive the situation entirely. Nobody
      could possibly be kinder or more considerate than Miss Madden. Of course
      she is American&mdash;or rather Irish-American, and I'm English, and our
      notions and ways are not always alike. But that has nothing to do with it.
      And it is not so much that she has many thousands a year, and I only a few
      hundreds. That in itself would signify nothing&mdash;and if I must take
      help from somebody I would rather take it from Celia Madden than anybody
      else I know&mdash;but this is the point, Mr. Thorpe. I do not eat the
      bread of dependence gracefully. I pull wry faces over it, and I don't try
      very much to disguise them. That is my fault. Yes&mdash;oh yes, I know it
      is a fault&mdash;but I am as I am. And if Miss Madden doesn't mind&mdash;why&rdquo;&mdash;she
      concluded with a mirthless, uncertain laugh&mdash;&ldquo;why on earth should
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, why should I?&rdquo; he echoed, reflectively. &ldquo;I should like desperately to
      tell you why. Sometime I will tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked on in silence for a brief space. Then she put out her hand for
      her wrap, and as she paused, he spread it over her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am amazed to think what we have been saying to each other,&rdquo; she said,
      buttoning the fur as they moved on again. &ldquo;I am vexed with myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And more still with me,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o&mdash;but I ought to be. You've made me talk the most shocking
      rubbish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There we disagree again, you know. Everything you've said's been perfect.
      What you're thinking of now is that I'm not an old enough friend to have
      been allowed to hear it. But if I'm not as old a friend as some, I wish I
      could make you feel that I'm as solid a friend as any&mdash;as solid and
      as staunch and as true. I wish I could hear you say you believed that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you talk of 'friends,'&rdquo; she said, in a tone not at all responsive&mdash;&ldquo;what
      is meant by 'friends'? We've chanced to meet twice&mdash;and once we
      barely exchanged civilities, and this time we've been hotel acquaintances&mdash;hardly
      more, is it?&mdash;and you and your young people have been very polite to
      me&mdash;and I in a silly moment have talked to you more about my affairs
      than I should&mdash;I suppose it was because you mentioned my father. But
      'friends' is rather a big word for that, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe pouted for a dubious moment. &ldquo;I can think of a bigger word still,&rdquo;
       he said, daringly. &ldquo;It's been on the tip of my tongue more than once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She quickened her pace. The air had grown perceptibly colder. The distant
      mountains, visible ever and again through the bare branches, were of a
      dark and cheerless blue, and sharply defined against the sky. It was not
      yet the sunset hour, and there were no mists, but the light of day seemed
      to be going out of the heavens. He hurried on beside her in depressed
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their companions were hidden from view in a convolution of the winding
      road, but they were so near that their voices could be heard as they
      talked. Frequently the sound of laughter came backward from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're jolly enough down there,&rdquo; he commented at last, moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a good reason for our joining them, isn't it?&rdquo; Her tone was at
      once casual and pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't want to join them!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Why don't you stay with me&mdash;and
      talk?&rdquo; &ldquo;But you bully me so,&rdquo; she offered in explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase caught his attention. Could it be that it expressed her real
      feeling? She had said, he recalled, that he had made her talk. Her
      complaint was like an admission that he could overpower her will. If that
      were true&mdash;then he had resources of masterfulness still in reserve
      sufficient to win any victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not bully you,&rdquo; he said slowly, as if objecting to the word
      rather than the idea. &ldquo;That wouldn't be possible to me. But you don't know
      me well enough to understand me. I am the kind of man who gets the things
      he wants. Let me tell you something: When I was at Hadlow, I had never
      shot a pheasant in my life. I used to do tolerably well with a rifle, but
      I hardly knew anything about a shot-gun, and I don't suppose I'd ever
      killed more than two or three birds on the wing&mdash;and that was ages
      ago. But I took the notion that I would shoot better than anybody else
      there. I made up my mind to it&mdash;and I simply did it, that's all. I
      don't know if you remember&mdash;but I killed a good deal more than both
      the others put together. I give you that as an example. I wanted you to
      think that I was a crack shot&mdash;and so I made myself be a crack shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very interesting,&rdquo; she murmured. They did not seem to be walking
      quite so fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think I want to brag about myself,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I don't fancy
      myself&mdash;in that way. I'm not specially proud of doing things&mdash;it's
      the things themselves that I care for. If some men had made a great
      fortune, they would be conceited about it. Well, I'm not. What I'm keen
      about is the way to use that fortune so that I will get the most out of it&mdash;the
      most happiness, I mean. The thing to do is to make up your mind carefully
      what it is that you want, and to put all your power and resolution into
      getting it&mdash;and the rest is easy enough. I don't think there's
      anything beyond a strong man's reach, if he only believes enough in
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But aren't you confusing two things?&rdquo; she queried. The subject apparently
      interested her. &ldquo;To win one's objects by sheer personal force is one
      thing. To merely secure them because one's purse is longer than other
      people's&mdash;that's quite another matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled grimly at her. &ldquo;Well, I'll combine the two,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose you will be altogether irresistible,&rdquo; she said, lightly.
      &ldquo;There will be no pheasants left for other people at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind being chaffed,&rdquo; he told her, with gravity. &ldquo;So long as
      you're good-natured, you can make game of me all you like. But I'm in
      earnest, all the same. I'm not going to play the fool with my money and my
      power. I have great projects. Sometime I'll tell you about them. They will
      all be put through&mdash;every one of them. And you wouldn't object to
      talking them over with me&mdash;would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion on 'projects' is of no earthly value&mdash;to myself or anyone
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still you'd give me your advice if I asked it?&rdquo; he persisted.
      &ldquo;Especially if it was a project in which you were concerned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment's constrained silence she said to him, &ldquo;You must have no
      projects, Mr. Thorpe, in which I am concerned. This talk is all very wide
      of the mark. You are not entitled to speak as if I were mixed up with your
      affairs. There is nothing whatever to warrant it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you help being in my projects if I put you there, and keep
      you there?&rdquo; he asked her, with gleeful boldness. &ldquo;And just ask yourself
      whether you do really want to help it. Why should you? You've seen enough
      of me to know that I can be a good friend. And I'm the kind of friend who
      amounts to something&mdash;who can and will do things for those he likes.
      What obligation are you under to turn away that kind of a friend, when he
      offers himself to you? Put that question plainly to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not in a position to nominate the questions that I am to put
      to myself,&rdquo; she said. The effort to import decision into her tone and
      manner was apparent. &ldquo;That is what I desire you to understand. We must not
      talk any more about me. I am not the topic of conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But first let me finish what I wanted to say,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;My talk
      won't break any bones. You'd be wrong not to listen to it&mdash;because
      it's meant to help you&mdash;to be of use to you. This is the thing, Lady
      Cressage: You're in a particularly hard and unpleasant position. Like my
      friend Plowden&rdquo;&mdash;he watched her face narrowly but in vain, in the
      dull light, for any change at mention of the name&mdash;&ldquo;like my friend
      Plowden you have a position and title to keep up, and next to nothing to
      keep it up on. But he can go down into the City and make money&mdash;or
      try to. He can accept Directorships and tips about the market and so on,
      from men who are disposed to be good to him, and who see how he can be of
      use to them&mdash;and in that way he can do something for himself. But
      there is the difference: you can't do these things, or you think you
      can't, which is the same thing. You're all fenced in; you're surrounded by
      notice-boards, telling you that you mustn't walk this way or look that
      way; that you mustn't say this thing or do the other. Now your friend down
      ahead there&mdash;Miss Madden&mdash;she doesn't take much stock in
      notice-boards. In fact, she feeds the gulls, simply because she's
      forbidden to do it. But you&mdash;you don't feed any gulls, and yet you're
      annoyed with yourself that you don't. Isn't that the case? Haven't I read
      you right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to have submitted to his choice of a topic. There was no touch
      of expostulation in the voice with which she answered him. &ldquo;I see what you
      think you mean,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think!&rdquo; he responded, with self-confident emphasis. &ldquo;I'm not 'thinking.'
      I'm reading an open book. As I say, you're not contented&mdash;you're not
      happy; you don't try to pretend that you are. But all the same, though you
      hate it, you accept it. You think that you really must obey your
      notice-boards. Now what I tell you you ought to do is to take a different
      view. Why should you put up all this barbed wire between yourself and your
      friends? It doesn't do anybody else any good&mdash;and it does you harm.
      Why, for example, should Plowden be free to take things from me, and you
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him, with a cold half-smile in her eye. &ldquo;Unfortunately I
      was not asked to join your Board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed his lips tightly together, and regarded her meditatively as he
      turned these words over in his mind. &ldquo;What I'm doing for Plowden,&rdquo; he said
      with slow vagueness meanwhile, &ldquo;it isn't so much because he's on the
      Board. He's of no special use to me there. But he was nice to me at a time
      when that meant everything in the world to me&mdash;and I don't forget
      things of that sort. Besides, I like him&mdash;and it pleases me to let
      him in for a share of my good fortune. See? It's my way of enjoying
      myself. Well now, I like you too, and why shouldn't I be allowed to let
      you in also for a share of that good fortune? You think there's a
      difference, but I tell you it's imaginary&mdash;pure moonshine. Why, the
      very people whose opinion you're afraid of&mdash;what did they do
      themselves when the South African craze was on? I'm told that the scum of
      the earth had only to own some Chartered shares, and pretend to be 'in the
      know' about them&mdash;and they could dine with as many duchesses as they
      liked. I knew one or two of the men who were in that deal&mdash;I wouldn't
      have them in my house&mdash;but it seems there wasn't any other house they
      couldn't go to in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, there were many houses,&rdquo; she interposed. &ldquo;It wasn't a nice
      exhibition that society made of itself&mdash;one admits that,&mdash;but it
      was only one set that quite lost their heads. There are all kinds of sets,
      you know. And&mdash;I don't think I see your application, in any event.
      The craze, as you call it, was all on a business basis. People ran after
      those who could tell them which shares were going up, and they gambled in
      those shares. That was all, wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still looking intently at her, he dismissed her query with a little shake
      of the head. &ldquo;'On a business basis,'&rdquo; he repeated, as if talking to
      himself. &ldquo;They like to have things 'on a business basis.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He halted, with a hand held out over her arm, and she paused as well, in a
      reluctant, tentative way. &ldquo;I don't understand you,&rdquo; she remarked, blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me put it in this way,&rdquo; he began, knitting his brows, and marshalling
      the thoughts and phrases with which his mind had been busy. &ldquo;This is the
      question. You were saying that you weren't asked to join my Board. You
      explained in that way how I could do things for Plowden, and couldn't do
      them for you. Oh, I know it was a joke&mdash;but it had its meaning&mdash;at
      least to me. Now I want to ask you&mdash;if I decide to form another
      Company, a very small and particular Company&mdash;if I should decide to
      form it, I say&mdash;could I come to you and ask you to join THAT Board?
      Of course I could ask&mdash;but what I mean is&mdash;well, I guess you
      know what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The metaphor had seemed to him a most ingenious and satisfactory vehicle
      for his purpose, and it had broken down under him amid evidences of
      confusion which he could not account for. All at once his sense of
      physical ascendancy had melted away&mdash;disappeared. He looked at Lady
      Cressage for an instant, and knew there was something shuffling and
      nerveless in the way his glance then shifted to the dim mountain chain
      beyond. His heart fluttered surprisingly inside his breast, during the
      silence which ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you must have said everything now that you wished to say,&rdquo; she
      observed at last. She had been studying intently the trodden snow at her
      feet, and did not even now look up. The constraint of her manner, and a
      certain pleading hesitation in her words, began at once to restore his
      self-command. &ldquo;Do not talk of it any further, I beg of you,&rdquo; she went on.
      &ldquo;We&mdash;we have been lagging behind unconscionably. If you wish to
      please me, let us hurry forward now. And please!&mdash;no more talk at
      all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But just a word&mdash;you're not angry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head very slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you do know that I'm your friend&mdash;your solid, twenty-four-carat
      friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment's pause, she made answer, almost in a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;Yes&mdash;be
      my friend&mdash;if it amuses you,&rdquo;&mdash;and led the way with precipitate
      steps down the winding road.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      TWO days later, Thorpe and his young people took an early morning train
      for Geneva&mdash;homeward bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was entirely easy to accept their uncle's declaration that urgent
      business summoned him to London, yet Julia and Alfred, when they chanced
      to exchange glances after the announcement, read in each other's eyes the
      formless impression that there were other things beside business. Their
      uncle, they realized, must be concerned in large and probably venturesome
      enterprises; but it did not fit with their conception of his character
      that commercial anxieties should possess the power to upset him. And upset
      he undeniably was.
    </p>
    <p>
      They traced his disturbance, in a general way, to the morning following
      the excursion up to Glion and Caux. He told them then that he had slept
      very badly, and that they must &ldquo;count him out&rdquo; of their plans for the day.
      He continued to be counted out of what remained of their stay at Territet.
      He professed not to be ill, but he was restless and preoccupied. He ate
      little, but smoked continuously, and drank spirits a good deal, which they
      had not seen him do before. Nothing would induce him to go out either day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, this disturbance of their uncle's equanimity
      synchronized with an apparent change in the attitude of their new friends
      on the floor below. This change was, indeed, more apparent than definable.
      The ladies were, to the nicest scrutiny, as kindly and affable as ever,
      but the sense of comradeship had somehow vanished. Insensibly, the two
      parties had ceased to have impulses and tastes in common. There were no
      more trips together&mdash;no more fortuitous luncheons or formal dinners
      as a group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people looked up at the front of the big hotel on this morning
      of departure, after they had clambered over the drifts into the
      snow-bedecked train, and opened the window of their compartment. They made
      sure that they could identify the windows of Miss Madden's suite, and that
      the curtains were drawn aside&mdash;but there was no other token of
      occupancy discernible. They had said good-bye to the two ladies the
      previous evening, of course&mdash;it lingered in their minds as a rather
      perfunctory ceremony&mdash;but this had not prevented their hoping for
      another farewell glimpse of their friends. No one came to wave a hand from
      the balcony, however, and the youngsters looked somewhat dubiously at each
      other as the train moved. Then intuitively they glanced toward their uncle&mdash;and
      perceived that he had his hat pulled over his eyes, and was staring with a
      kind of moody scowl at the lake opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately, it is a clear day,&rdquo; said Julia. &ldquo;We shall see Mont Blanc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice seemed to have a hollow and unnatural sound in her own ears.
      Neither her uncle nor her brother answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast, meanwhile, in the apartment toward which the young people
      had turned their farewell gaze in vain, Miss Madden sipped her coffee
      thoughtfully while she read a letter spread upon the table beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's as they said,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;You are not allowed to drive in the
      mountains with your own horses and carriage. That seems rather quaint for
      a model Republic&mdash;doesn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay they're quite right,&rdquo; Lady Cressage replied, listlessly. &ldquo;It's
      in the interest of safety. People who do not know the mountains would
      simply go and get killed in avalanches and hurricanes&mdash;and all that.
      I suppose that is what the Government wishes to prevent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're on the side of the Government,&rdquo; said the other, with a twinkle
      in her brown eyes. &ldquo;Truly now&mdash;you hated the whole idea of driving
      over the Simplon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage lifted her brows in whimsical assent as she nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you like this Russian plan any better?&rdquo; demanded Celia. &ldquo;I wish
      for once you would be absolutely candid and open with me&mdash;and let me
      know to the uttermost just what you think.&rdquo; &ldquo;'For once'?&rdquo; queried the
      other. Her tone was placid enough, but she allowed the significance of the
      quotation to be marked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I never wholly know what you're thinking,&rdquo; Miss Madden declared. She
      put on a smile to alleviate the force of her remarks. &ldquo;It is not you alone&mdash;Edith.
      Don't think that! But it is ingrained in your country-women. You can't
      help it. It's in your blood to keep things back. I've met numbers of
      English ladies who, I'm ready to believe, would be incapable of telling an
      untruth. But I've never met one of whom I could be sure that she would
      tell me the whole truth. Don't you see this case in point,&rdquo; she pursued,
      with a little laugh, &ldquo;I could not drag it out of you that you disliked the
      Simplon idea, so long as there was a chance of our going. Immediately we
      find that we can't go, you admit that you hated it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wanted to go,&rdquo; objected Lady Cressage, quietly. &ldquo;That was the
      important thing. What I wanted or did not want had nothing to do with the
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Celia's face clouded momentarily. &ldquo;Those are not the kind of things I like
      to hear you say,&rdquo; she exclaimed, with a certain vigour. &ldquo;They put
      everything in quite a false light. I am every whit as anxious that you
      should be pleased as that I should. You know that well enough. I've said
      it a thousand times&mdash;and have I ever done anything to disprove it?
      But I never can find out what you do want&mdash;what really will please
      you! You never will propose anything; you never will be entirely frank
      about the things I propose. It's only by watching you out of the corner of
      my eye that I can ever guess whether anything is altogether to your liking
      or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The discussion seemed to be following lines familiar to them both. &ldquo;That
      is only another way of saying what you discovered long ago,&rdquo; said Lady
      Cressage, passively&mdash;&ldquo;that I am deficient in the enthusiasms. But
      originally you were of the opinion that you had enthusiasms enough for
      two, and that my lack of them would redress the balance, so to speak. I
      thought it was a very logical opinion then, and, from my own point of
      view, I think so now. But if it does not work in practice, at least the
      responsibility of defending it is not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delightful!&rdquo; cried Celia, smiling gayly as she put down her cup again.
      &ldquo;You are the only woman I've ever known who was worth arguing with. The
      mere operation makes me feel as if I were going through Oxford&mdash;or
      passing the final Jesuit examinations. Heaven knows, I would get up
      arguments with you every day, for the pure enjoyment of the thing&mdash;if
      I weren't eternally afraid of saying something that would hurt your
      feelings, and then you wouldn't tell me, but would nurse the wound in
      silence in the dark, and I should know that something was wrong, and have
      to watch you for weeks to make out what it was&mdash;and it would all be
      too unhappy. But it comes back, you see, to what I said before. You don't
      tell me things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edith smiled in turn, affectionately enough, but with a wistful reserve.
      &ldquo;It is a constitutional defect&mdash;even national, according to you. How
      shall I hope to change, at this late day? But what is it you want me to
      tell you?&mdash;I forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Russian thing. To go to Vienna, where we get our passports, and then
      to Cracow, and through to Kief, which they say is awfully well worth while&mdash;and
      next Moscow&mdash;and so on to St. Petersburg, in time to see the ice
      break up. It is only in winter that you see the characteristic Russia:
      that one has always heard. With the furs and the sledges, and the three
      horses galloping over the snow&mdash;it seems to me it must be the best
      thing in Europe&mdash;if you can call Russia Europe. That's the way it
      presents itself to me&mdash;but then I was brought up in a half-Arctic
      climate, and I love that sort of thing&mdash;in its proper season. It is
      different with you. In England you don't know what a real winter is. And
      so I have to make quite sure that you think you would like the Russian
      experiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed gently. &ldquo;But if I don't know what a real winter is, how
      can I tell whether I will like it or not? All I do know is that I am
      perfectly willing to go and find out. Oh yes&mdash;truly&mdash;I should
      like very much to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Madden sighed briefly. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said, but with a notable
      absence of conviction in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A space of silence ensued, as she opened and glanced through another note,
      the envelope of which had borne no postmark. She pouted her lips over the
      contents of this missive, and raised her eyebrows in token of surprise,
      but as she laid it down she looked with a frank smile at her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's from our young friend,&rdquo; she explained, genially&mdash;&ldquo;the
      painter-boy&mdash;Mr. D'Aubigny. It is to remind me of a promise he says I
      made&mdash;that when I came to London he should paint my portrait. I don't
      think I promised anything of the kind&mdash;but I suppose that is a
      detail. It's all my unfortunate hair. They must have gone by this time&mdash;they
      were to go very early, weren't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage glanced at the clock. &ldquo;It was 8:40, I think&mdash;fully half
      an hour ago,&rdquo; she answered, with a painstaking effect of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious conglomeration&rdquo;&mdash;mused the other. &ldquo;The boy and girl are so
      civilized, and their uncle is so rudimentary. I'm afraid they are spoiling
      him just as the missionaries spoil the noble savage. They ought to go away
      and leave him alone. As a barbarian he was rather effective&mdash;but they
      will whitewash him and gild him and make a tame monstrosity of him. But I
      suppose it's inevitable. Having made his fortune, it is the rule that he
      must set up as a gentleman. We do it more simply in America. One
      generation makes the fortune, and leaves it to the next generation to put
      on the frills. My father, for example, never altered in the slightest
      degree the habits he formed when he was a poor workman. To the day of his
      death, blessed old man, he remained what he had always been&mdash;simple,
      pious, modest, hard-working, kindly, and thrifty&mdash;a model peasant.
      Nothing ever tempted him a hair's-breadth out of the path he had been bred
      to walk in. But such nobility of mind and temper with it all! He never
      dreamed of suggesting that I should walk in the same path. From my
      earliest childhood I cannot remember his ever putting a limitation upon me
      that wasn't entirely sensible and generous. I must have been an extremely
      trying daughter, but he never said so; he never looked or acted as if he
      thought so.&mdash;But I never stop when I begin talking of my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's always very sweet to me to hear you talk of him,&rdquo; Lady Cressage put
      in. &ldquo;One knows so few people who feel that way about their fathers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Celia nodded gravely, as if in benevolent comment upon something that had
      been left unsaid. The sight of the young artist's note recalled her
      earlier subject. &ldquo;Of course there is a certain difference,&rdquo; she went on,
      carelessly,&mdash;&ldquo;this Mr. Thorpe is not at all a peasant, as the phrase
      goes. He strikes one, sometimes, as having been educated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he was at a public school, Lord Plowden tells me,&rdquo; said the other,
      with interest. &ldquo;And his people were booksellers&mdash;somewhere in London&mdash;so
      that he got a good smattering of literature and all that. He certainly has
      more right to set up as a gentleman than nine out of ten of the nouveaux
      riches one sees flaunting about nowadays. And he can talk very well indeed&mdash;in
      a direct, practical sort of way. I don't quite follow you about his niece
      and nephew spoiling him. Of course one can see that they have had a great
      effect upon him. He sees it himself&mdash;and he's very proud of it. He
      told me so, quite frankly. But why shouldn't it be a nice effect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; Celia replied, idly. &ldquo;It seemed to me that he was the
      kind of piratical buccaneer who oughtn't to be shaved and polished and
      taught drawing-room tricks&mdash;I feel that merely in the interest of the
      fitness of things. Have you looked into his eyes&mdash;I mean when they've
      got that lack-lustre expression? You can see a hundred thousand dead men
      in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the look you mean,&rdquo; said Lady Cressage, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I assume he is going to kill anybody,&rdquo; pursued Miss Madden, with
      ostensible indifference, but fixing a glance of aroused attention upon her
      companion's face, &ldquo;or that he has any criminal intentions whatever. He
      behaves very civilly indeed, and apparently his niece and nephew idolize
      him. He seems to be the soul of kindness to them. It may be that I'm
      altogether wrong about him&mdash;only I know I had the instinct of alarm
      when I caught that sort of dull glaze in his eye. I met an African
      explorer a year ago, or so, about whose expeditions dark stories were
      told, and he had precisely that kind of eye. Perhaps it was this that put
      it into my head&mdash;but I have a feeling that this Thorpe is an
      exceptional sort of man, who would have the capacity in him for terrible
      things, if the necessity arose for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; the other repeated. She toyed with the bread-crumbs
      about her plate, and reflectively watched their manipulation into squares
      and triangles as she went on. &ldquo;But may that not be merely the visible sign
      of an exceptionally strong and masterful character? And isn't it, after
      all, the result of circumstances whether such a character makes, as you
      put it, a hundred thousand dead men, or enriches a hundred thousand lives
      instead? We agree, let us say, that this Mr. Thorpe impresses us both as a
      powerful sort of personality. The question arises, How will he use his
      power? On that point, we look for evidence. You see a dull glaze in his
      eye, and you draw hostile conclusions from it. I reply that it may mean no
      more than that he is sleepy. But, on the other hand, I bring proofs that
      are actively in his favour. He is, as you say, idolized by the only two
      members of his family that we have seen&mdash;persons, moreover, who have
      been brought up in ways different to his own, and who would not start,
      therefore, with prejudices in his favour. Beyond that, I know of two cases
      in which he has behaved, or rather undertaken to behave, with really
      lavish generosity&mdash;and in neither case was there any claim upon him
      of a substantial nature. He seems to me, in fact, quite too much disposed
      to share his fortune with Tom, Dick, and Harry&mdash;anybody who excites
      his sympathy or gets into his affections.&rdquo; Having said this much, Lady
      Cressage swept the crumbs aside and looked up. &ldquo;So now,&rdquo; she added, with a
      flushed smile, &ldquo;since you love arguments so much, how do you answer that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Celia smiled back. &ldquo;Oh, I don't answer it at all,&rdquo; she said, and her voice
      carried a kind of quizzical implication. &ldquo;Your proofs overwhelm me. I know
      nothing of him&mdash;and you know so much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage regarded her companion with a novel earnestness and
      directness of gaze. &ldquo;I had a long, long talk with him&mdash;the afternoon
      we came down from Glion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Madden rose, and going to the mantel lighted a cigarette. She did not
      return to the table, but after a brief pause came and took an easy-chair
      beside her friend, who turned to face her. &ldquo;My dear Edith,&rdquo; she said, with
      gravity, &ldquo;I think you want to tell me about that talk&mdash;and so I beg
      you to do so. But if I'm mistaken&mdash;why then I beg you to do nothing
      of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other threw out her hands with a gesture of wearied impatience, and
      then clasped them upon her knee. &ldquo;I seem not to know what I want! What is
      the good of talking about it? What is the good of anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&mdash;now!&rdquo; Celia's assumption of a monitor's tone had reference,
      apparently, to something understood between the two, for Lady Cressage
      deferred to it, and even summoned the ghost of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is really nothing to tell,&rdquo;&mdash;she faltered, hesitatingly&mdash;&ldquo;that
      is, nothing happened. I don't know how to say it&mdash;the talk left my
      mind in a whirl. I couldn't tell you why. It was no particular thing that
      was said&mdash;it seemed to be more the things that I thought of while
      something else was being talked about&mdash;but the whole experience made
      a most tremendous impression upon me. I've tried to straighten it out in
      my own mind, but I can make nothing of it. That is what disturbs me,
      Celia. No man has ever confused me in this silly fashion before. Nothing
      could be more idiotic. I'm supposed to hold my own in conversation with
      people of&mdash;well, with people of a certain intellectual rank,&mdash;but
      this man, who is of hardly any intellectual rank at all, and who rambled
      on without any special aim that one could see&mdash;he reduced my brain to
      a sort of porridge. I said the most extraordinary things to him&mdash;babbling
      rubbish which a school-girl would be ashamed of. How is that to be
      accounted for? I try to reason it out, but I can't. Can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nerves,&rdquo; said Miss Madden, judicially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is meaningless,&rdquo; the other declared. &ldquo;Anybody can say 'nerves.'
      Of course, all human thought and action is 'nerves.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yours is a special case of nerves,&rdquo; Celia pursued, with gentle
      imperturbability. &ldquo;I think I can make my meaning clear to you&mdash;though
      the parallel isn't precisely an elegant one. The finest thoroughbred dog
      in the world, if it is beaten viciously and cowed in its youth, will
      always have a latent taint of nervousness, apprehension, timidity&mdash;call
      it what you like. Well, it seems to me there's something like that in your
      case, Edith. They hurt you too cruelly, poor girl. I won't say it broke
      your nerve&mdash;but it made a flaw in it. Just as a soldier's old wound
      aches when there's a storm in the air&mdash;so your old hurt distracts and
      upsets you under certain psychological conditions. It's a rather clumsy
      explanation, but I think it does explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;I don't know,&rdquo; Edith replied, in a tone of melancholy
      reverie. &ldquo;It makes a very poor creature out of me, whatever it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather lose patience, Edith,&rdquo; her companion admonished her, gravely.
      &ldquo;Nobody has a right to be so deficient in courage as you allow yourself to
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm not a coward,&rdquo; the other protested. &ldquo;I could be as brave as
      anybody&mdash;as brave as you are&mdash;if a chance were given me. But of
      what use is bravery against a wall twenty feet high? I can't get over it.
      I only wound and cripple myself by trying to tear it down, or break
      through it.&mdash;Oh yes, I know what you say! You say there is no wall&mdash;that
      it is all an illusion of mine. But unfortunately I'm unable to take that
      view. I've battered myself against it too long&mdash;too sorely, Celia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Celia shrugged her shoulders in comment. &ldquo;Oh, we women all have our walls&mdash;our
      limitations&mdash;if it comes to that,&rdquo; she said, with a kind of
      compassionate impatience in her tone. &ldquo;We are all ridiculous together&mdash;from
      the point of view of human liberty. The free woman is a fraud&mdash;a
      myth. She is as empty an abstraction as the 'Liberty, Equality,
      Fraternity' that the French put on their public buildings. I used to have
      the most wonderful visions of what independence would mean. I thought that
      when I was absolutely my own master, with my money and my courage and my
      free mind, I would do things to astonish all mankind. But really the most
      I achieve is the occasional mild surprise of a German waiter. Even that
      palls on one after a time. And if you were independent, Edith&mdash;if you
      had any amount of money&mdash;what difference do you think it would make
      to you? What could you do that you don't do, or couldn't do, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now&rdquo;&mdash;said the other, looking up with a thin smile&mdash;&ldquo;now is
      an interval&mdash;an oasis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Madden's large, handsome, clear-hued face, habitually serene in its
      expression, lost something in composure as she regarded her companion. &ldquo;I
      don't know why you should say that,&rdquo; she observed, gently enough, but with
      an effect of reproof in her tone. &ldquo;I have never put limits to the
      connection, in my own mind&mdash;and it hadn't occurred to me that you
      were doing so in yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm not,&rdquo; interposed Lady Cressage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I understand you less than ever. Why do you talk about an
      'interval'? What was the other word?&mdash;'oasis'&mdash;as if this were a
      brief halt for refreshments and a breathing-spell, and that presently you
      must wander forth into the desert again. That suggestion is none of mine.
      We agreed that we would live together&mdash;'pool our issues,' as they say
      in America. I wanted a companion; so did you. I have never for an instant
      regretted the arrangement. Some of my own shortcomings in the matter I
      have regretted. You were the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen,
      and you were talented, and you seemed to like me&mdash;and I promised
      myself that I would add cheerfulness and a gay spirit to your other gifts&mdash;and
      in that I have failed wofully. You're not happy. I see that only too
      clearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;I'm a weariness and a bore to you,&rdquo; broke in the other,
      despondingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is precisely what you're not,&rdquo; Celia went on. &ldquo;We mustn't use words
      of that sort. They don't describe anything in our life at all. But I
      should be better pleased with myself if I could really put my finger on
      what it is that is worrying you. Even if we decided to break up our
      establishment, I have told you that you should not go back to what you
      regard as poverty. Upon that score, I had hoped that your mind was easy.
      As I say, I think you attach more importance to money than those who have
      tested its powers would agree to&mdash;but that's neither here nor there.
      You did not get on well on 600 pounds a year&mdash;and that is enough. You
      shall never have less than twice that amount, whether we keep together or
      not&mdash;and if it ought to be three times the amount, that doesn't
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't seem to realize, Edith&rdquo;&mdash;she spoke with increased
      animation&mdash;&ldquo;that you are my caprice. You are the possession that I am
      proudest of and fondest of. There is nothing else that appeals to me a
      hundredth part as much as you do. Since I became independent, the one real
      satisfaction I have had is in being able to do things for you&mdash;to
      have you with me, and make you share in the best that the world can offer.
      And if with it all you remain unhappy, why then you see I don't know what
      to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know&mdash;I behave very badly!&rdquo; Lady Cressage had risen, and with
      visible agitation began now to pace the room. &ldquo;I deserve to be thrown into
      the lake&mdash;I know it well enough! But Celia&mdash;truly&mdash;I'm as
      incapable of understanding it as you are. It must be that I am possessed
      by devils&mdash;like the people in the New Testament. Perhaps someone will
      come along who can cast them out. I don't seem able to do it myself. I
      can't rule myself at all. It needs a strength I haven't got!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Celia, thoughtfully. The excited sentences which Edith threw
      over her shoulder as she walked appeared, upon examination, to contain a
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; she asked abruptly, after a moment's silence, &ldquo;do you
      want to marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage paused at the mantel, and exchanged a long steadfast glance
      with her friend. Then she came slowly forward. &ldquo;Ah, that is what I don't
      know,&rdquo; she answered. Apparently the reply was candid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Madden pursed her lips, and frowned a little in thought. Then, at
      some passing reflection, she smiled in a puzzled fashion. At last she also
      rose, and went to the mantel for another cigarette. &ldquo;Now I am going to
      talk plainly,&rdquo; she said, with decision. &ldquo;Since the subject is mentioned,
      less harm will be done by speaking out than by keeping still. There is a
      debate in your mind on the matter, isn't there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other lady, tall, slender, gently ruminative once more, stood at the
      window and with bowed head looked down at the lake. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I suppose
      it might be called that,&rdquo; she replied, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you hesitate to tell me about it? You would rather not?&rdquo; Celia, after
      an instant's pause, went on without waiting for an answer. &ldquo;I beg that you
      won't assume my hostility to the idea, Edith. In fact, I'm not sure I
      don't think it would be the best thing for you to do. Marriage, a home,
      children&mdash;these are great things to a woman. We can say that she pays
      the price of bondage for them&mdash;but to know what that signifies, we
      must ask what her freedom has been worth to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interposed the other, from the window. &ldquo;What have I done with my
      freedom that has been worth while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; murmured Celia, under her breath. She moved forward, and stood
      beside Edith, with an arm round her waist. They looked together at the
      lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Lord Plowden, is it not?&rdquo; asked the American, as the silence grew
      constrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage looked up alertly, and then hesitated over her reply. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
       she said at last. Upon reflection, and with a dim smile flickering in her
      side-long glance at Celia, she added, &ldquo;He wants to marry you, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that out of consideration,&rdquo; said Celia, composedly. &ldquo;He has never
      said so. I think it was more his mother's idea than his, if it existed at
      all. Of course I am not marrying him, or anybody else. But I saw at Hadlow
      that you and he were&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;old friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must marry money,&rdquo; the other replied. In an unexpected burst of
      candour she went on: &ldquo;He would have asked me to marry him if I had had
      money. There is no harm in telling you that. It was quite understood&mdash;oh,
      two years ago. And I think I wished I had the money&mdash;then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don't wish it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight shake of Edith's small, shapely head served for answer. After a
      little, she spoke in a musing tone: &ldquo;He is going to have money of his own,
      very soon, but I don't think it would attract me now. I like him
      personally, of course, but&mdash;there is no career, no ambition, no
      future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Viscount has future enough behind him,&rdquo; observed Celia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't attract me,&rdquo; the other repeated, vaguely. &ldquo;He is handsome, and
      clever, and kind and all that&mdash;but he would never appeal to any of
      the great emotions&mdash;nor be capable of them himself He is too smooth,
      too well-balanced, too much the gentleman. That expresses it badly&mdash;but
      do you see what I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Celia turned, and studied the beautiful profile beside her, in a steady,
      comprehending look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I see what you mean,&rdquo; she said, with significance in her
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage flushed, and released herself from her companion's arm. &ldquo;But
      I don't know myself what I mean!&rdquo; she exclaimed, despairingly, as she
      moved away. &ldquo;I don't know!&mdash;I don't know!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON the last day of February, Mrs. Dabney was surprised if not exhilarated
      by a visit from her two children in the little book-shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the last day in the world that I should have thought you'd 'a' come
      out on,&rdquo; she told them, in salutation&mdash;and for comment they all
      glanced along the dark narrow alley of shelves to the street window. A
      gloomy spectacle it was indeed, with a cold rain slanting through the
      discredited remnants of a fog, which the east wind had broken up, but
      could not drive away, and with only now and again a passer-by moving
      across the dim vista, masked beneath an umbrella, or bent forward with
      chin buried in turned-up collar. In the doorway outside the sulky boy
      stamped his feet and slapped his sides with his arms in pantomimic mutiny
      against the task of guarding the book-stalls' dripping covers, which
      nobody would be mad enough to pause over, much less to lift.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know but I'd ought to let the boy bring in the books and go
      home,&rdquo; she said, as their vague gaze was attracted by his gestures. &ldquo;But
      it isn't three yet&mdash;it seems ridiculous to close up. Still, if you'd
      be more comfortable upstairs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mamma! The idea of making strangers of us,&rdquo; protested Julia. She
      strove to make her tone cheerful, but its effect of rebuke was
      unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother, leaning against the tall desk, looked blankly at her daughter.
      The pallid flicker of the gas-jet overhead made her long, listless face
      seem more devoid of colour than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are as good as strangers, aren't you?&rdquo; she observed, coldly.
      &ldquo;You've been back in town ten days and more, and I've scarcely laid eyes
      upon either of you. But don't you want to sit down? You can put those
      parcels on the floor anywhere. Or shall I do it for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred had been lounging in the shadowed corner against a heap of old
      magazines tied in bundles. He sprang up now and cleared the chair, but his
      sister declined it with a gesture. Her small figure had straightened
      itself into a kind of haughty rigidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has been so much to do, mamma,&rdquo; she explained, in a clear, cool
      voice. &ldquo;We have had hundreds of things to buy and to arrange about. All
      the responsibility for the housekeeping rests upon me&mdash;and Alfred has
      his studio to do. But of course we should have looked in upon you sooner&mdash;and
      much oftener&mdash;if we had thought you wanted us. But really, when we
      came to you, the very day after our return, it was impossible for us to
      pretend that you were glad to see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was glad enough,&rdquo; Mrs. Dabney made answer, mechanically. &ldquo;Why
      shouldn't I be glad? And why should you think I wasn't glad? Did you
      expect me to shout and dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said you wouldn't come to see us in Ovington Square,&rdquo; Alfred
      reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's different,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;What would I be doing in Ovington
      Square? It's all right for you to be there. I hope you'll be happy there.
      But it wouldn't add anything to your happiness to have me there; it would
      be quite the other way about. I know that, if you DON'T. This is my place,
      here, and I intend to stick to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julia's bright eyes, scanning the apathetic, stubborn maternal
      countenance, hardened beyond their wont. &ldquo;You talk as if there had been
      some class war declared,&rdquo; she said, with obvious annoyance. &ldquo;You know that
      Uncle Stormont would like nothing better than to be as nice to you as he
      is to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Stormont!&rdquo; Mrs. Dabney's repetition of the words was surcharged
      with hostile sarcasm. &ldquo;But his name was Stormont as much as it was Joel,&rdquo;
       broke in Alfred, from his dark corner. &ldquo;He has a perfect right to use the
      one he likes best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't dispute his right,&rdquo; she replied, once more in her passionless
      monotone. &ldquo;Everybody can call themselves whatever they please. It's no
      affair of mine. You and your sister spell your father's name in a way to
      suit yourselves: I never interfered, did I? You have your own ideas and
      your own tastes. They are quite beyond me&mdash;but they're all right for
      you. I don't criticize them at all. What I say is that it is a great mercy
      your uncle came along, with his pockets full of money to enable you to
      make the most of them. If I were religious I should call that
      providential.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's what we DO call it,&rdquo; put in Julia, with vivacity. &ldquo;And why
      should you shut your doors against this Providence, mamma? Just think of
      it! We don't insist upon your coming to live at Ovington Square at all.
      Probably, as you say, you would be happier by yourself&mdash;at least for
      the present. But when Uncle St&mdash;when uncle says there's more than
      enough money for us all, and is only too anxious for you to let him do
      things for you&mdash;why, he's your own brother! It's as if I should
      refuse to allow Alfred to do things for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you never did,&rdquo; interposed the young man, gayly. &ldquo;I'll say that for
      you, Jule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And never will,&rdquo; she assured him, with cheerful decision. &ldquo;But no&mdash;mamma&mdash;can't
      you see what we mean? We have done what you wanted us to do. You sent us
      both to much better schools than you could afford, from the time we were
      of no age at all&mdash;and when uncle's money came you sent us to
      Cheltenham. We did you no discredit. We worked very well; we behaved
      ourselves properly. We came back to you at last with fair reason to
      suppose that you would be&mdash;I won't say proud, but at least well
      satisfied with us&mdash;and then it turned out that you didn't like us at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said anything of the sort,&rdquo; the mother declared, with a touch of
      animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no&mdash;you never said it,&rdquo; Julia admitted, &ldquo;but what else can we
      think you mean? Our uncle sends for us to go abroad with him, and you busy
      yourself getting me ready, and having new frocks made and all that&mdash;and
      I never hear a suggestion that you don't want me to go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did want you to go,&rdquo; Mrs. Dabney affirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, when I come back&mdash;when we come back, and tell you what
      splendid and generous plans uncle has made for us, and how he has taken a
      beautiful furnished house and made it our home, and so on,&mdash;why, you
      won't even come and look at the house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't want to see it,&rdquo; the mother retorted; obstinately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you needn't!&rdquo; said Alfred, rising. &ldquo;Nobody will ask you
      again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yes they will,&rdquo; urged Julia, glancing meaningly from one to
      the other. All her life, as it seemed, she had been accustomed to mediate
      between these two unpliable and stubborn temperaments. From her earliest
      childhood she had understood, somehow, that there was a Dabney habit of
      mind, which was by comparison soft and if not yielding, then politic: and
      set over against it there was a Thorpe temper full of gnarled and twisted
      hardnesses, and tenacious as death. In the days of her grandfather Thorpe,
      whom she remembered with an alarmed distinctness, there had existed a kind
      of tacit idea that his name alone accounted for and justified the most
      persistent and stormy bad temper. That old man with the scowling brows
      bullied everybody, suspected everybody, apparently disliked everybody,
      vehemently demanded his own will of everybody&mdash;and it was all to be
      explained, seemingly, by the fact that he was a Thorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his disappearance from the scene&mdash;unlamented, to the best of
      Julia's juvenile perceptions&mdash;there had been relatively peaceful
      times in the book-shop and the home overhead, yet there had existed always
      a recognized line of demarcation running through the household. Julia and
      her father&mdash;a small, hollow-chested, round-shouldered young man, with
      a pale, anxious face and ingratiating manner, who had entered the shop as
      an assistant, and remained as a son-in-law, and was now the thinnest of
      unsubstantial memories&mdash;Julia and this father had stood upon one side
      of this impalpable line as Dabneys, otherwise as meek and tractable
      persons, who would not expect to have their own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred and his mother were Thorpes&mdash;that is to say, people who
      necessarily had their own way. Their domination was stained by none of the
      excesses which had rendered the grandfather intolerable. Their surface
      temper was in truth almost sluggishly pacific. Underneath, however, ugly
      currents and sharp rocks were well known to have a potential existence&mdash;and
      it was the mission of the Dabneys to see that no wind of provocation
      unduly stirred these depths. Worse even than these possibilities of
      violence, however, so far as every-day life was concerned, was the strain
      of obstinacy which belonged to the Thorpe temper. A sort of passive
      mulishness it was, impervious to argument, immovable under the most
      sympathetic pressure, which particularly tried the Dabney patience. It
      seemed to Julia now, as she interposed her soothing influence between
      these jarring forces, that she had spent whole years of her life in
      personal interventions of this sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes they will,&rdquo; she repeated, and warned her brother into the
      background with a gesture half-pleading half-peremptory. &ldquo;We are your
      children, and we're not bad or undutiful children at all, and I'm sure
      that when you think it all over, mamma, you'll see that it would be absurd
      to let anything come between you and us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I help letting it come?&rdquo; demanded the mother, listlessly
      argumentative. &ldquo;You had outgrown me and my ways altogether. It was
      nonsense to suppose that you would have been satisfied to come back and
      live here again, over the shop. I couldn't think for the life of me what I
      was going to do with you. But now your uncle has taken all that into his
      own hands. He can give you the kind of home that goes with your education
      and your ideas&mdash;and what more do you want? Why should you come
      bothering me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unjust you are, mamma!&rdquo; cried Julia, with a glaze of tears upon her
      bright glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow took her elbow from the desk, and, slowly straightening herself,
      looked down upon her daughter. Her long plain face, habitually grave in
      expression, conveyed no hint of exceptional emotion, but the fingers of
      the large, capable hands she clasped before her writhed restlessly against
      one another, and there was a husky-threat of collapse in her voice as she
      spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ever have children of your own,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you slave your
      life out to bring them up so that they'll think themselves your betters,
      and they act accordingly&mdash;then you'll understand. But you don't
      understand now&mdash;and there's no good our talking any more about it.
      Come in whenever it's convenient&mdash;and you feel like it. I must go
      back to my books now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took up a pen at this, and opened the cash-book upon the blotter. Her
      children, surveying her blankly, found speech difficult. With some
      murmured words, after a little pause, they bestowed a perfunctory kiss
      upon her unresponsive cheek, and filed out into the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dabney watched them put up their umbrella, and move off Strandward
      beneath it. She continued to look for a long time, in an aimless,
      ruminating way, at the dismal prospect revealed by the window and the
      glass of the door. The premature night was closing in miserably, with
      increasing rain, and a doleful whistle of rising wind round the corner. At
      last she shut up the unconsidered cash-book, lighted another gas-jet, and
      striding to the door, rapped sharply on the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring everything in!&rdquo; she called to the boy, and helped out his
      apprehension by a comprehensive gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when he had completed his task, and one of the two narrow outlets
      from the shop in front was satisfactorily blocked with the wares from
      without, and all the floor about reeked with the grimy drippings of the
      oilskins, Mrs. Dabney summoned him to the desk in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you may go home now,&rdquo; she said to him, with the laconic
      abruptness to which he was so well accustomed. &ldquo;You have a home, haven't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Remembering the exhaustive enquiries which the Mission people had made
      about him and his belongings, as a preliminary to his getting this job, he
      could not but be surprised at the mistress's question. In confusion he
      nodded assent, and jerked his finger toward his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a mother?&rdquo; she pursued. Again he nodded, with augmented confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think yourself better than she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The urchin's dirty and unpleasant face screwed itself up in anxious
      perplexity over this strange query. Then it cleared as he thought he
      grasped the idea, and the rat-eyes he lifted to her gleamed with the fell
      acuteness of the Dials. &ldquo;I sh'd be sorry if I wasn't,&rdquo; he answered, in
      swift, rasping accents. &ldquo;She's a rare old boozer, she is! It's a fair
      curse to an honest boy like me, to 'ave&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Go home!&rdquo; she bade him,
      peremptorily&mdash;and frowned after him as he ducked and scuttled from
      the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to herself, Mrs. Dabney did not reopen the cash-book&mdash;the
      wretched day, indeed, had been practically a blank in its history&mdash;but
      loitered about in the waning light among the shelves near the desk,
      altering the position of books here and there, and glancing cursorily
      through others. Once or twice she went to the door and looked out upon the
      rain-soaked street. A tradesman's assistant, opposite, was rolling the
      iron shutters down for the night. If business in hats was over for the
      day, how much more so in books! Her shop had never been fitted with
      shutters&mdash;for what reason she could not guess. The opened pages of
      numerous volumes were displayed close against the window, but no one had
      ever broken a pane to get at them. Apparently literature raised no desires
      in the criminal breast. To close the shop there was nothing to do but lock
      and bolt the door and turn out the lights. At last, as the conviction of
      nightfall forced itself upon her from the drenched darkness outside, she
      bent to put her hand to the key. Then, with a little start of surprise,
      she stood erect. Someone was shutting an umbrella in the doorway,
      preparatory to entering the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her brother, splashed and wet to the knees, but with a glowing
      face, who pushed his way in, and confronted her with a broad grin. There
      was such a masterful air about him, that when he jovially threw an arm
      round her gaunt waist, and gathered her up against his moist shoulder, she
      surprised herself by a half-laughing submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her vocabulary was not rich in phrases for this kind of emergency. &ldquo;Do
      mind what you're about!&rdquo; she told him, flushing not unpleasurably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up the place!&rdquo; he answered, with lordly geniality. &ldquo;I've walked all
      the way from the City in the rain. I wanted the exertion&mdash;I couldn't
      have sat in a cab. Come back and build up the fire, and let's have a talk.
      God! What things I've got to tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't any fire down here,&rdquo; she said, apologetically, as they edged
      their way through the restricted alley to the rear. &ldquo;The old fireplace
      took up too much room. Sometimes, in very sharp weather, I have an
      oil-stove in. Usually the gas warms it enough. You don't find it too cold&mdash;do
      you?&mdash;with your coat on? Or would you rather come upstairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the cold,&rdquo; he replied, throwing a leg over the stool before
      the desk. &ldquo;I can't stay more 'n a minute or two. What do you think we've
      done today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louisa had never in her life seen her brother look so well as he did now,
      sprawling triumphantly upon the stool under the yellow gas-light. His
      strong, heavily-featured face had somehow ceased to be commonplace. It had
      acquired an individual distinction of its own. He looked up at her with a
      clear, bold eye, in which, despite its gloss of good-humour, she discerned
      a new authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nervous and apprehensive lines had somehow vanished from the
      countenance, and with them, oddly enough, that lethargic, heavy expression
      which had been their complement. He was all vigour, readiness, confidence,
      now. She deemed him almost handsome, this curious, changeable brother of
      hers, as he beat with his fist in a measured way upon the desk-top to
      emphasize his words, and fastened his commanding gaze upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We took very nearly twenty thousand pounds to-day,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;This is
      the twenty-eighth of February. A fortnight ago today was the first
      settlement. I wasn't here, but Semple was&mdash;and the working of it is
      all in his hands. He kept as still as a mouse that first day. They had to
      deliver to us 26,000 shares, and they hadn't got one, but we didn't make
      any fuss. The point was, you see, not to let them dream that they were
      caught in a trap. We didn't even put the price up to par. They had to come
      to Semple, and say there didn't seem to be any shares obtainable just at
      the moment, and what would he carry them over at? That means, to let them
      postpone delivery for another fortnight. He was as smooth as sweet-oil
      with them, and agreed to carry them over till today without any charge at
      all. But today it was a little different. The price was up ten shillings
      above par. That is to say, Semple arranged with a jobber, on the quiet,
      d'ye see? to offer thirty shillings for our one-pound shares. That offer
      fixed the making-up price. So then, when they were still without shares
      to-day, and had to be carried over again, they had to pay ten shillings'
      difference on each of twenty-six thousand shares, plus the difference
      between par and the prices they'd sold at. That makes within a few
      hundreds of 20,000 pounds in cash, for one day's haul. D'ye see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded at him, expressively. Through previous talks she had really
      obtained an insight into the operation, and it interested her more than
      she would have cared to confess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, we put that 20,000 pounds in our pockets,&rdquo; he proceeded with
      a steady glow in his eyes. &ldquo;A fortnight hence, that is March 14th, we ring
      the bell on them again, and they march up to the captain's office and
      settle a second time. Now what happens on the 14th? A jobber makes the
      price for Semple again, and that settles the new sum they have to pay us
      in differences. It is for us to say what that price shall be. We'll decide
      on that when the time comes. We most probably will just put it up another
      ten shillings, and so take in just a simple 13,000 pounds. It's best in
      the long run, I suppose, to go slow, with small rises like that, in order
      not to frighten anybody. So Semple says, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not frighten them?&rdquo; Louisa asked. &ldquo;I thought you wanted to
      frighten them. You were full of that idea a while ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled genially. &ldquo;I've learned some new wrinkles since then. We'll
      frighten 'em stiff enough, before we're through with them. But at the
      start we just go easy. If they got word that there was a 'corner,' there
      would be a dead scare among the jobbers. They'd be afraid to sell or name
      a price for Rubber Consols unless they had the shares in hand. And there
      are other ways in which that would be a nuisance. Presently, of course, we
      shall liberate some few shares, so that there may be some actual dealings.
      Probably a certain number of the 5,000 which went to the general public
      will come into the market too. But of course you see that all such shares
      will simply go through one operation before they come back to us. Some one
      of the fourteen men we are squeezing will snap them up and bring them
      straight to Semple, to get free from the fortnightly tax we are levying on
      them. In that way we shall eventually let out say half of these fourteen
      'shorts,' or perhaps more than half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to do that for?&rdquo; The sister's grey eyes had caught a
      metallic gleam, as if from the talk about gold. &ldquo;Why let anybody out? Why
      can't you go on taking their money for ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe nodded complacently. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that's what I asked too. It seemed
      to me the most natural thing, when you'd got 'em in the vise, to keep them
      there. But when you come to reflect&mdash;you can't get more out of a man
      than there is in him. If you press him too hard, he can always go bankrupt&mdash;and
      then he's out of your reach altogether, and you lose everything that you
      counted on making out of him. So, after a certain point, each one of the
      fourteen men whom we're squeezing must be dealt with on a different
      footing. We shall have to watch them all, and study their resources, as
      tipsters watch horses in the paddock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, some of them can stand a loss of a hundred thousand pounds
      better than others could lose ten thousand. All that we have to know. We
      can take it as a principle that none of them will go bankrupt and lose his
      place on the exchange unless he is pressed tight to the wall. Well, our
      business is to learn how far each fellow is from the wall to start with.
      Then we keep track of him, one turn of the screw after another, till we
      see he's got just enough left to buy himself out. Then we'll let him out.
      See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's cruel, isn't it?&rdquo; she commented, calmly meditative, after a little
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything in the City is cruel,&rdquo; he assured her with a light tone. &ldquo;All
      speculative business is cruel. Take our case, for example. I estimate in a
      rough way that these fourteen men will have to pay over to us, in
      differences and in final sales, say seven hundred thousand pounds&mdash;maybe
      eight hundred. Well, now, not one of those fellows ever earned a single
      sovereign of that money. They've taken the whole of it from others, and
      these others took it from others still, and so on almost indefinitely.
      There isn't a sovereign of it that hasn't been through twenty hands, or
      fifty for that matter, since the last man who had done some honest work
      for it parted company with it. Well&mdash;money like that belongs to those
      who are in possession of it, only so long as they are strong enough to
      hold on to it. When someone stronger still comes along, he takes it away
      from them. They don't complain: they don't cry and say it's cruel. They
      know it's the rule of the game. They accept it&mdash;and begin at once
      looking out for a new set of fools and weaklings to recoup themselves on.
      That's the way the City goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had concluded his philosophical remarks with ruminative slowness.
      As he lapsed into silence now, he fell to studying his own hands on the
      desk-top before him. He stretched out the fingers, curved them in
      different degrees, then closed them tight and turned the bulky
      hard-looking fists round for inspection in varying aspects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the kind of hand,&rdquo; he began again, thoughtfully, &ldquo;that breaks the
      Jew in the long run, if there's only grit enough behind it. I used to
      watch those Jews' hands, a year ago, when I was dining and wining them.
      They're all thin and wiry and full of veins. Their fingers are never
      still; they twist round and keep stirring like a lobster's feelers. But
      there aint any real strength in 'em. They get hold of most of the things
      that are going, because they're eternally on the move. It's their hellish
      industry and activity that gives them such a pull, and makes most people
      afraid of them. But when a hand like that takes them by the throat&rdquo;&mdash;he
      held up his right hand as he spoke, with the thick uncouth fingers and
      massive thumb arched menacingly in a powerful muscular tension&mdash;&ldquo;when
      THAT tightens round their neck, and they feel that the grip means business&mdash;my
      God! what good are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed contemptuously, and slapped the relaxed palm on the desk with a
      noise which made his sister start. Apparently the diversion recalled
      something to her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a man in here asking about you today,&rdquo; she remarked, in a
      casual fashion. &ldquo;Said he was an old friend of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, everybody's my 'old friend' now,&rdquo; he observed with beaming
      indifference. &ldquo;I'm already getting heaps of invitations to dinners and
      dances and all that. One fellow insisted on booking me for Easter for some
      salmon fishing he's got way down in Cumberland. I told him I couldn't
      come, but he put my name down all the same. Says his wife will write to
      remind me. Damn his wife! Semple tells me that when our squeeze really
      begins and they realize the desperate kind of trap they're in, they'll
      simply shower attentions of that sort on me. He says the social pressure
      they can command, for a game of this kind, is something tremendous. But
      I'm not to be taken in by it for a single pennyworth, d'ye see? I dine
      with nobody! I fish and shoot and go yachting with nobody! Julia and
      Alfred and our own home in Ovington Square&mdash;that'll be good enough
      for me. By the way&mdash;you haven't been out to see us yet. We're all
      settled now. You must come at once&mdash;why not with me, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louisa paid no heed to this suggestion. She had been rummaging among some
      loose papers on the top of the desk, and she stepped round now to lift the
      lid and search about for something inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left a card for you,&rdquo; she said, as she groped among the desk's
      contents. &ldquo;I don't know what I did with it. He wrote something on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn him, and his card too,&rdquo; Thorpe protested easily. &ldquo;I don't want
      to see either of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he knew you in Mexico. He said you'd had dealings together. He
      seemed to act as if you'd want to see him&mdash;but I didn't know. I
      didn't tell him your address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had listened to these apathetic sentences without much interest,
      but the sum of their message appeared suddenly to catch his attention. He
      sat upright, and after a moment's frowning brown study, looked sharply up
      at his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo; he asked with abruptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't in the least remember,&rdquo; she made answer, holding the desk-top up,
      but temporarily suspending her search. &ldquo;He was a little man,
      five-and-fifty, I should think. He had long grey hair&mdash;a kind of
      Quaker-looking man. He said he saw the name over the door, and he
      remembered your telling him your people were booksellers. He only got back
      here in England yesterday or the day before. He said he didn't know what
      you'd been doing since you left Mexico. He didn't even know whether you
      were in England or not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had been looking with abstracted intentness at a set of green-bound
      cheap British poets just at one side of his sister's head. &ldquo;You must find
      that card!&rdquo; he told her now, with a vague severity in his voice. &ldquo;I know
      the name well enough, but I want to see what he's written. Was it his
      address, do you remember? The name itself was Tavender, wasn't it? Good
      God! Why is it a woman never knows where she's put anything? Even Julia
      spends hours looking for button-hooks or corkscrews or something of that
      sort, every day of her life! They've got nothing in the world to do except
      know where things are, right under their nose, and yet that's just what
      they don't know at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have a good few other things to do,&rdquo; she reminded him, as she
      fumbled again inside the obscurity of the desk. &ldquo;I can put my hand on any
      one of four thousand books in stock,&rdquo; she mildly boasted over her
      shoulder, &ldquo;and that's something you never learned to do. And I can tell if
      a single book is missing&mdash;and I wouldn't trust any shopman I ever
      knew to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh of course, you're an exception,&rdquo; he admitted, under a sense of
      justice. &ldquo;But I wish you'd find the card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know where it is,&rdquo; she suddenly announced, and forthwith closed the
      desk. Moving off into the remoter recesses of the crowded interior, she
      returned to the light with the bit of pasteboard in her hand. &ldquo;I'd stuck
      it in the little mirror over the washstand,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He almost snatched it from her, and stood up the better to examine it
      under the gas-light. &ldquo;Where is Montague Street?&rdquo; he asked, with rough
      directness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Bloomsbury&mdash;alongside the Museum. That's one Montague Street&mdash;I
      don't know how many others there may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had already taken up his umbrella and was buttoning his coat. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Bloomsbury,&rdquo;
       he said hurriedly. &ldquo;That would be his form. And you say he knew nothing
      about my movements or whereabouts&mdash;nothing about the Company, eh?&rdquo; He
      looked at his watch as he spoke. Evidently the presence of this stranger
      had excited him a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she assured him, reflectively; &ldquo;no, I'm sure he didn't. From what he
      said, he doesn't know his way about London very well, or anywhere else,
      for that matter, I should say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe nodded, and put his finger to his forehead with a meaning look. &ldquo;No&mdash;he's
      a shade off in the upper story,&rdquo; he told her in a confidential tone.
      &ldquo;Still, it's important that I should see him,&rdquo;&mdash;and with only a hasty
      hand-shake he bustled out of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the light of the street lamp opposite, she could see him on the
      pavement, in the pelting rain, vehemently signalling with his umbrella for
      a cab.

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got a spare room here, haven't we?&rdquo; Thorpe asked his niece, when
      she came out to greet him in the hall of their new home in Ovington
      Square. He spoke with palpable eagerness before even unbuttoning his damp
      great-coat, or putting off his hat. &ldquo;I mean it's all in working order
      ready for use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes, uncle,&rdquo; Julia answered, after a moment's thought. &ldquo;Is someone
      coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; he replied, with a grunt of relief. He seemed increasingly
      pleased with the project he had in mind, as she helped him off with his
      things. The smile he gave her, when she playfully took his arm to lead him
      into the adjoining library, was clearly but a part of the satisfied grin
      with which he was considering some development in his own affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got into his slippers and into the easy-chair before the bright fire
      and lit a cigar with a contented air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my little girl?&rdquo; he said, with genial inconsequence, and smiled
      again at her, where she stood beside the mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be such a lark to play the hostess to a stranger!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
      &ldquo;When is he coming?&mdash;I suppose it is a 'he,'&rdquo; she added, less
      buoyantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;that fellow,&rdquo; Thorpe said, as if he had been thinking of
      something else. &ldquo;Well&mdash;I can't tell just when he will turn up. I only
      learned he was in town&mdash;or in England&mdash;a couple of hours ago. I
      haven't seen him yet at all. I drove round to his lodgings, near the
      British Museum, but he wasn't there. He only comes there to sleep, but
      they told me he turned in early&mdash;by nine o'clock or so. Then I went
      round to a hotel and wrote a note for him, and took it back to his
      lodgings, and left it for him. I told him to pack up his things as soon as
      he got it, and drive here, and make this his home&mdash;for the time being
      at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's some old friend of yours?&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I know I shall like
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe laughed somewhat uneasily. &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;he's a kind of a
      friend of mine,&rdquo; he said, with a note of hesitation in his voice. &ldquo;I don't
      know, though, that you'll think much of him. He aint what you'd call a
      ladies' man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again at some thought the words conjured up. &ldquo;He's a curious,
      simple old party, who'd just like a comfortable corner somewhere by
      himself, and wouldn't expect to be talked to or entertained at all. If he
      does come, he'll keep to himself pretty well. He wouldn't be any company
      for you. I mean,&mdash;for you or Alfred either. I think he's a Canadian
      or West Indian,&mdash;British subject, at all events,&mdash;but he's lived
      all his life in the West, and he wouldn't know what to do in a
      drawing-room, or that sort of thing. You'd better just not pay any
      attention to him. Pass the time of day, of course, but that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julia's alert, small-featured face expressed some vague disappointment at
      what she heard, but her words were cheerful enough. &ldquo;Oh of course&mdash;whatever
      he likes best,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will tell Potter to make everything ready. I
      suppose there's no chance of his being here in time for dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe shook his head, and then lifted his brows over some new perplexity.
      &ldquo;I guess he'd want to eat his meals out, anyway,&rdquo; he said, after some
      thought. &ldquo;I don't seem to remember much about him in that respect&mdash;of
      course, everything was so different in camp out in Mexico&mdash;but I
      daresay he wouldn't be much of an ornament at the table. However, that'll
      be all right. He's as easy to manage as a rabbit. If I told him to eat on
      the roof, he'd do it without a murmur. You see it's this way, Julia: he's
      a scientific man&mdash;a kind of geologist, and mining expert and rubber
      expert&mdash;and chemical expert and all sort of things. I suppose he must
      have gone through college&mdash;very likely he'll turn out to have better
      manners than I was giving him credit for. I've only seen him in the rough,
      so to speak. We weren't at all intimate then,&mdash;but we had dealings
      together, and there are certain important reasons why I should keep close
      in touch with him while he's here in London. But I'll try and do that
      without letting you be bothered.&rdquo; &ldquo;What an idea!&rdquo; cried Julia. &ldquo;As if that
      wasn't what we had the house for&mdash;to see the people you want to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle smiled rather ruefully, and looked in a rather dubious way at
      his cigar. &ldquo;Between you and me and the lamp-post, Jule,&rdquo; he said, with a
      slow, whimsical drawl, &ldquo;there isn't a fellow in the world that I wanted to
      see less than I did him. But since he's here&mdash;why, we've got to make
      the best of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, Thorpe suffered the youngsters to go up to the drawing-room
      in the tacit understanding that he should probably not see them again that
      night. He betook himself then once more to the library, as it was called&mdash;the
      little, cozy, dark-panelled room off the hall, where the owner of the
      house had left two locked bookcases, and where Thorpe himself had
      installed a writing-desk and a diminutive safe for his papers. The chief
      purpose of the small apartment, however, was indicated by the two big,
      round, low-seated easy-chairs before the hearth, and by the cigar boxes
      and spirit-stand and tumblers visible behind the glass of the cabinet
      against the wall. Thorpe himself called the room his &ldquo;snuggery,&rdquo; and spent
      many hours there in slippered comfort, smoking and gazing contentedly into
      the fire. Sometimes Julia read to him, as he sat thus at his ease, but
      then he almost invariably went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when he had poured out some whiskey and water and lit a cigar, the
      lounging chairs somehow did not attract him. He moved about aimlessly in
      the circumscribed space, his hands in his pockets, his burly shoulders
      rounded, his face dulled and heavy as with a depression of doubt. The
      sound of the piano upstairs came intermittently to his ears. Often he
      ascended to the drawing-room to hear Julia play&mdash;and more often
      still, with all the doors open, he enjoyed the mellowed murmur of her
      music here at his ease in the big chair. But tonight he had no joy in the
      noise. More than once, as he slouched restlessly round the room, the
      notion of asking her to stop suggested itself, but he forbore to put it
      into action. Once he busied himself for a time in kneeling before his
      safe, and scrutinizing in detail the papers in one of the bundles it
      contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last&mdash;it was after ten o'clock, and the music above had ceased&mdash;the
      welcome sounds of cab-wheels without, and then of the door-bell, came to
      dispel his fidgeting suspense. On the instant he straightened himself, and
      his face rearranged its expression. He fastened upon the door of the room
      the controlled, calm glance of one who is easily confident about what is
      to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quaker-looking&rdquo; was not an inapt phrase for the person whom the maid
      ushered into the room through this door. He was a small, thin, elderly
      man, bowed of figure and shuffling in gait. His coat and large,
      low-crowned hat, though worn almost to shabbiness, conveyed an indefinable
      sense of some theological standard, or pretence to such a standard. His
      meagre face, too, with its infinity of anxious yet meaningless lines, and
      its dim spectacled eyes, so plainly overtaxed by the effort to discern
      anything clearly, might have belonged to any old village priest grown
      childish and blear-eyed in the solitude of stupid books. Even the blotches
      of tell-tale colour on his long nose were not altogether unclerical in
      their suggestion. A poor old man he seemed, as he stood blinking in the
      electric light of the strange, warm apartment&mdash;a helpless, worn old
      creature, inured through long years to bleak adverse winds, hoping now for
      nothing better in this world than present shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Thorpe,&rdquo; he said, after a moment, with nervous
      formality. &ldquo;This is unexpectedly kind of you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;not at all!&rdquo; said Thorpe, shaking him cordially by the hand.
      &ldquo;What have we got houses for, but to put up our old friends? And how are
      you, anyway? You've brought your belongings, have you? That's right!&rdquo; He
      glanced into the hall, to make sure that they were being taken upstairs,
      and then closed the door. &ldquo;I suppose you've dined. Take off your hat and
      coat! Make yourself at home. That's it&mdash;take the big chair, there&mdash;so!
      And now let's have a look at you. Well, Tavender, my man, you haven't
      grown any younger. But I suppose none of us do. And what'll you have to
      drink? I take plain water in mine, but there's soda if you prefer it. And
      which shall it be&mdash;Irish or Scotch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tavender's countenance revealed the extremity of his surprise and
      confusion at the warmth of this welcome. It apparently awed him as well,
      for though he shrank into a corner of the huge chair, he painstakingly
      abstained from resting his head against its back. Uncovered, this head
      gained a certain dignity of effect from the fashion in which the thin,
      iron-grey hair, parted in the middle, fell away from the full,
      intellectual temples, and curled in meek locks upon his collar. A vague
      resemblance to the type of Wesley&mdash;or was it Froebel?&mdash;might
      have hinted itself to the observer's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe's thoughts, however, were not upon types. &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;he said,
      from the opposite chair, in his roundest, heartiest voice, when the other
      had with diffidence suffered himself to be served, and had deferentially
      lighted on one side the big cigar pressed upon him&mdash;&ldquo;Well&mdash;and
      how's the world been using you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very handsomely, Mr. Thorpe,&rdquo; the other responded, in a hushed,
      constrained tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, chuck the Misters!&rdquo; Thorpe bade him. &ldquo;Aren't we old pals, man? You're
      plain Tavender, and I'm plain Thorpe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're very kind,&rdquo; murmured Tavender, still abashed. For some minutes he
      continued to reply dolefully, and with a kind of shamefaced reluctance, to
      the questions piled upon him. He was in evil luck: nothing had gone well
      with him; it had been with the greatest difficulty that he had scraped
      together enough to get back to London on the chance of obtaining some
      expert commission; practically he possessed nothing in the world beyond
      the clothes on his back, and the contents of two old carpet-bags&mdash;these
      admissions, by degrees, were wormed from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have you parted with the concession, then, that you bought from me?&rdquo;
       Thorpe suddenly asked him. &ldquo;Help yourself to some more whiskey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tavender sighed as he tipped the decanter. &ldquo;It isn't any good,&rdquo; he
      answered, sadly. &ldquo;The Government repudiates it&mdash;that is, the Central
      Government at Mexico. Of course, I never blamed you. I bought it with my
      eyes open, and you sold it in perfect good faith. I never doubted that at
      all. But it's not worth the paper it's written on&mdash;that's certain.
      It's that that busted me&mdash;that, and some other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well!&rdquo; said Thorpe, blankly. His astonishment was obviously
      genuine, and for a little it kept him silent, while he pondered the novel
      aspects of the situation thus disclosed. Then his eyes brightened, as a
      new path outlined itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you've got the papers?&mdash;the concession and my transfer to
      you and all that?&rdquo; he asked, casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied Tavender. He added, with a gleam of returning
      self-command&mdash;&ldquo;That's all I have got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's see&mdash;what was it you paid me?&mdash;Three thousand eight
      hundred pounds, wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tavender made a calculation in mental arithmetic. &ldquo;Yes, something like
      that. Just under nineteen thousand dollars,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Thorpe, with slow emphasis, &ldquo;I won't allow you to suffer
      that way by me. I'll buy it back from you at the same price you paid for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tavender, beginning to tremble, jerked himself upright in his chair, and
      stared through his spectacles at his astounding host. &ldquo;You say&rdquo;&mdash;he
      gasped&mdash;&ldquo;you say you'll buy it back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Thorpe. &ldquo;That's what I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I never heard of such a thing!&rdquo; the other faltered with
      increasing agitation. &ldquo;No&mdash;you can't mean it. It isn't common sense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's common decency,&rdquo; replied the big man, in his most commanding manner.
      &ldquo;It's life and death to you&mdash;and it doesn't matter a flea-bite to me.
      So, since you came to grief through me, why shouldn't I do the fair thing,
      and put you back on your legs again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tavender, staring now at those shrunken legs of his, breathed heavily. The
      thing overwhelmed him. Once or twice he lifted his head and essayed to
      speak, but no speech came to his thin lips. He moistened them eventually
      with a long deliberate pull at his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This much ought to be understood, however,&rdquo; Thorpe resumed, reflecting
      upon his words as he went along. &ldquo;If I'm to buy back a dead horse, like
      that, it's only reasonable that there should be conditions. I suppose
      you've seen by this time that even if this concession of ours was
      recognized by the Government there wouldn't be any money in it to speak
      of. I didn't realize that two years ago, any more than you did, but it's
      plain enough now. The trade has proved it. A property of rubber trees has
      no real value&mdash;so long as there's a wilderness of rubber trees all
      round that's everybody's property. How can a man pay even the interest on
      his purchase money, supposing he's bought a rubber plantation, when he has
      to compete with people who've paid no purchase money at all, but just get
      out as much as they like from the free forest? You must know that that is
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tavender nodded eloquently. &ldquo;Oh yes, I know that is so. You can prove it
      by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe grinned a little. &ldquo;As it happens, that aint what I need to have you
      prove,&rdquo; he said, dryly. &ldquo;Now WE know that a rubber property is no good&mdash;but
      London doesn't know it. Everybody here thinks that it's a great business
      to own rubber trees. Why, man alive, do you know&rdquo;&mdash;the audacity of
      the example it had occurred to him to cite brought a gratified twinkle to
      his eyes as he went on&mdash;&ldquo;do you know that a man here last year
      actually sold a rubber plantation for four hundred thousand pounds&mdash;two
      millions of dollars! Not in cash, of course, but in shares that he could
      do something with&mdash;and before he's done with it, I'm told, he's going
      to make twice that amount of money out of it. That'll show you what London
      is like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I suppose they do those things,&rdquo; remarked Tavender, vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;my point is that perhaps I can do something or other with this
      concession of yours here. I may even be able to get my money back on it.
      At any rate I'll take my chances on it&mdash;so that at least you shan't
      lose anything by it. Of course, if you'd rather try and put it on the
      market yourself, why go ahead!&rdquo; There was a wistful pathos in the way
      Tavender shook his head. &ldquo;Big money doesn't mean anything to me any more,&rdquo;
       he said, wearily. &ldquo;I'm too old and I'm too tired. Why&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;yes,
      half a dozen times I've had enough money to last me comfortably all my
      life&mdash;and every time I've used it as bait to catch bigger money with,
      and lost it all. I don't do that any more! I've got something the matter
      with me internally that takes the nerve all out of me. The doctors don't
      agree about it, but whatever its name is I've got it for keeps. Probably I
      shan't live very long&rdquo;&mdash;Thorpe recalled that the old man had always
      taken a gloomy view of his health after the third glass&mdash;&ldquo;and if you
      want to pay me the nineteen thousand dollars, or whatever it is, why I
      shall say 'God bless you,' and be more than contented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there's something more to it than that,&rdquo; observed Thorpe, with an
      added element of business-like briskness in his tone. &ldquo;If I let you out in
      this way&mdash;something, of course, you could never have dreamed would
      happen&mdash;you must do some things for me. I should want you, for
      example, to go back to Mexico at once. Of course, I'd pay your expenses
      out. Or say, I'd give you a round four thousand pounds to cover that and
      some other things too. You wouldn't object to that, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man who, two hours before, had confronted existence with the change of
      his last five-pound note in his pocket, did not hesitate now. &ldquo;Oh no, that
      would be all right,&rdquo; with reviving animation, he declared. He helped
      himself again from the cut-glass decanter. &ldquo;What would you want me to do
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a report on the concession for a starter,&rdquo; Thorpe answered, with
      careful indifference. &ldquo;I suppose they still know your name as an
      authority. I could make that all right anyway. But one thing I ought to
      speak of&mdash;it might be rather important&mdash;I wouldn't like to have
      you mention to anybody that the concession has at any time been yours.
      That might tend to weaken the value of your report, don't you see? Let it
      be supposed that the concession has been my property from the start. You
      catch my point, don't you? There never was any such thing as a transfer of
      it to you. It's always been mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tavender gave his benefactor a purblind sort of wink. &ldquo;Always belonged to
      you? Why of course it did,&rdquo; he said cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other breathed a cautious prolonged sigh of relief &ldquo;You'd better light
      a fresh one, hadn't you?&rdquo; he asked, observing with a kind of contemptuous
      tolerance the old man's efforts to ignite a cigar which had more than once
      unrolled like a carpenter's shaving in his unaccustomed fingers, and was
      now shapelessly defiant of both draught and suction. Tavender laughed to
      himself silently as he took a new cigar, and puffed at the match held by
      his companion. The air of innocence and long-suffering meekness was
      falling rapidly away from him. He put his shabby boots out confidently to
      the fender and made gestures with his glass as he talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistake,&rdquo; he declared, in insistent tones, &ldquo;was in not turning down
      science thirty years ago and going in bodily for business. Then I should
      have made my pile as you seem to have done. But I tried to do something of
      both. Half the year I was assaying crushings, or running a level, or
      analyzing sugars, for a salary, and the other half I was trying to do a
      gamble with that salary on the strength of what I'd learned. You can't
      ring the bell that way. You've got to be either a pig or a pup. You can't
      do both. Now, for instance, if I'd come to London when you did, and
      brought my money with me instead of buying your concession with it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what good do you suppose you would have done?&rdquo; Thorpe interrupted
      him with good-natured brusqueness. &ldquo;You'd have had it taken from you in a
      fortnight! Why, man, do you know what London is? You'd have had no more
      chance here than a naked nigger in a swamp-full of alligators.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have hit it off,&rdquo; the other objected. &ldquo;This is as fine a
      house as I was ever in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With me it's different,&rdquo; Thorpe replied, carelessly. &ldquo;I have the talent
      for money-making. I'm a man in armour. The 'gators can't bite me, nor yet
      the rattle-snakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;men are made up differently,&rdquo; Tavender assented, with
      philosophical gravity. Then he lurched gently in the over-large chair, and
      fixed an intent gaze upon his host. &ldquo;What did you make your money in?&rdquo; he
      demanded, not with entire distinctness of enunciation. &ldquo;It wasn't rubber,
      was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe shook his head. &ldquo;There's no money in rubber. I'm entirely in
      finance&mdash;on the Stock Exchange&mdash;dealing in differences,&rdquo; he
      replied, with a serious face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explanation seemed wholly acceptable to Tavender. He mused upon it
      placidly for a time, with his reverend head pillowed askew against the
      corner of the chair. Then he let his cigar drop, and closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the house bent forward, and noiselessly helped himself to
      another glass of whiskey and water. Then, sinking back again, he eyed his
      odd guest meditatively as he sipped the drink. He said to himself that in
      all the miraculous run of luck which the year had brought him, this was
      the most extraordinary manifestation of the lot. It had been so easy to
      ignore the existence of this tiresome and fatuous old man, so long as he
      was in remote Mexico, that he had practically forgotten him. But he should
      not soon forget the frightened shock with which he had learned of his
      presence in London, that afternoon. For a minute or two, there in his
      sister's book-shop, it had seemed as if he were falling through the air&mdash;as
      if the substantial earth had crumbled away from under him. But then his
      nerve had returned to him, his resourceful brain had reasserted itself.
      With ready shrewdness he had gone out, and met the emergency, and made it
      the servant of his own purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could be glad now, unreservedly glad, that Tavender had come to London,
      that things had turned out as they had. In truth, he stood now for the
      first time on solid ground. When he thought of it, now, the risk he had
      been running all these months gave him a little sinking of the heart. Upon
      reflection, the performance of having sold the same property first to
      Tavender in Mexico and then to the Rubber Consols Company in London might
      be subject to injurious comment, or worse. The fact that it was not a real
      property to begin with had no place in his thoughts. It was a concession&mdash;and
      concessions were immemorially worth what they would fetch. But the other
      thing might have been so awkward&mdash;and now it was all right!
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour and more, till the fire burnt itself out and the guest's
      snoring became too active a nuisance, Thorpe sat lost in this
      congratulatory reverie. Then he rose, and sharply shaking Tavender into a
      semblance of consciousness, led him upstairs and put him to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later he personally saw Tavender off at Waterloo station by the
      steamer-train, en route for Southampton and New York. The old man was in
      childlike good spirits, looking more ecclesiastical than ever in the new
      clothes he had been enabled to buy. He visibly purred with content
      whenever his dim eyes caught sight of the new valise and steamer trunk,
      which belonged to him, on the busy platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been very kind to me, Thorpe,&rdquo; he said more than once, as they
      stood together beside the open door of the compartment. &ldquo;I was never so
      hospitably treated before in my life. Your attention to me has been
      wonderful. I call you a true friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right! Glad to do it,&rdquo; replied the other, lightly. In
      truth he had not let Tavender stray once out of his sight during those
      three days. He had dragged him tirelessly about London, showing him the
      sights from South Kensington Museum to the Tower, shopping with him,
      resting in old taverns with him, breakfasting, lunching, aud dining with
      him&mdash;in the indefatigable resolution that he should strike up no
      dangerous gossiping acquaintance with strangers. The task had been
      tiresome in the extreme&mdash;but it had been very well worth while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing I'm rather sorry about,&rdquo; Tavender remarked, in apologetic
      parenthesis&mdash;&ldquo;I ought to have gone down and seen that brother-in-law
      of mine in Kent. He's been very good to me, and I'm not treating him very
      well. I wrote to tell him I was coming&mdash;but since then I haven't had
      a minute to myself. However, I can write to him and explain how it
      happened. And probably I'll be over again sometime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; said Thorpe, absently. The allusion to the
      brother-in-law in Kent had escaped his notice, so intent was he upon a new
      congeries of projects taking vague shape in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of yourself as my man out there,&rdquo; he said now, slowly, following
      the clue of his thoughts. &ldquo;There may be big things to do. Write to me as
      often as you can. Tell me everything that's going on. Money will be no
      object to me&mdash;you can have as much as you like&mdash;if things turn
      up out there that are worth taking up. But mind you say nothing about me&mdash;or
      any connection you've ever had with me. You'll get a letter from the
      Secretary of a Company and the Chairman asking for a report on a certain
      property, and naming a fee. You simply make a good report&mdash;on its
      merits. You say nothing about anything else&mdash;about me, or the history
      of the concession, or its validity, or anything. I mustn't be alluded to
      in any way. You quite understand that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me!&rdquo; said the old man, and wrung his benefactor's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed with a trustful eye that Thorpe watched the train draw out
      of the station.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE week following the August Bank Holiday is very rarely indeed a busy or
      anxious time in the City. In the ordinary course of things, it serves as
      the easy-going prelude&mdash;with but casual and inattentive visits
      eastward, and with only the most careless glances through the financial
      papers&mdash;to the halcyon period of the real vacation. Men come to the
      City during this week, it is true, but their thoughts are elsewhere&mdash;on
      the moors, on the blue sea, on the glacier or the fiord, or the pleasant
      German pine forests.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the great mass of City people; this August in question began in a
      normal enough fashion. To one little group of operators, however, and to
      the widening circle of brokers, bankers, and other men of affairs whose
      interests were more or less involved with those of this group, it was a
      season of keen perturbation. A combat of an extraordinary character was
      going on&mdash;a combat which threatened to develop into a massacre. Even
      to the operators who, unhappily for themselves, were principals in this
      fight, it was a struggle in the dark. They knew little about it, beyond
      the grimly-patent fact that they were battling for their very lives. The
      outer ring of their friends and supporters and dependents knew still less,
      though their rage and fears were perhaps greater. The &ldquo;press&rdquo; seemed to
      know nothing at all. This unnatural silence of the City's mouthpieces,
      usually so resoundingly clamorous upon the one side and the other when a
      duel is in progress, gave a sinister aspect to the thing. The papers had
      been gagged and blindfolded for the occasion. This in itself was of
      baleful significance. It was not a duel which they had been bribed to
      ignore. It was an assassination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outwardly there was nothing to see, save the unofficial, bald statement
      that on August 1st, the latest of twelve fortnightly settlements in this
      stock, Rubber Consols had been bid for, and carried over, at 15 pounds for
      one-pound shares. The information concerned the public at large not at
      all. Nobody knew of any friend or neighbour who was fortunate enough to
      possess some of these shares. Readers here and there, noting the figures,
      must have said to themselves that certain lucky people were coining money,
      but very little happened to be printed as to the identity of these people.
      Stray notes were beginning to appear in the personal columns of the
      afternoon papers about a &ldquo;Rubber King&rdquo; of the name of Thorpe, but the
      modern exploitation of the world's four corners makes so many &ldquo;kings&rdquo; that
      the name had not, as yet, familiarized itself to the popular eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      City men, who hear more than they read, knew in a general way about this
      &ldquo;Rubber King.&rdquo; He was an outsider who had come in, and was obviously
      filling his pockets; but it was a comforting rule that outsiders who did
      this always got their pockets emptied for them again in the long run.
      There seemed nothing about Thorpe to suggest that he would prove an
      exception to the rule. He was investing his winnings with great freedom,
      so the City understood, and his office was besieged daily by promoters and
      touts. They could clean out his strong-box faster than the profits of his
      Rubber corner could fill it. To know such a man, however, could not but be
      useful, and they made furtive notes of his number in Austin Friars on
      their cuffs, after conversation had drifted from him to other topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the Rubber corner itself, the Stock Exchange as a whole was
      apathetic. When some of the sufferers ventured cautious hints about the
      possibility of official intervention on their behalf, they were laughed at
      by those who did not turn away in cold silence. Of the fourteen men who
      had originally been caught in the net drawn tight by Thorpe and Semple,
      all the conspicuous ones belonged to the class of &ldquo;wreckers,&rdquo; a class
      which does not endear itself to Capel Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Rostocker and Aronson, who, it was said, were worst hit, were men of
      great wealth, but they had systematically amassed these fortunes by
      strangling in their cradles weak enterprises, and by undermining and
      toppling over other enterprises which would not have been weak if they had
      been given a legitimate chance to live. Their system was legal enough, in
      the eyes alike of the law and of the Stock Exchange rules. They had an
      undoubted right to mark out their prey and pursue it, and bring it down,
      and feed to the bone upon it. But the exercise of this right did not make
      them beloved by the begetters and sponsors of their victims. When word
      first went round, on the last day of February, that a lamb had
      unexpectedly turned upon these two practised and confident wolves, and had
      torn an ear from each of them, and driven them pell-mell into a &ldquo;corner,&rdquo;
       it was received on all sides with a gratified smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, by fortnightly stages, the story grew at once more tragic and more
      satisfactory. Not only Rostocker and Aronson, but a dozen others were in
      the cul de sac guarded by this surprising and bloody-minded lamb. Most of
      the names were well-known as those of &ldquo;wreckers.&rdquo; In this category
      belonged Blaustein, Ganz, Rothfoere, Lewis, Ascher, and Mendel, and if
      Harding, Carpenter, and Vesey could not be so confidently classified, at
      least their misfortune excited no particular sympathy. Two other names
      mentioned, those of Norfell and Pinney, were practically unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some surprise, however, at the statement that the old and
      respected and extremely conservative firm of Fromentin Bros. was entangled
      in the thing. Egyptian bonds, minor Levantine loans, discounts in the
      Arabian and Persian trades&mdash;these had been specialties of the
      Fromentins for many years. Who could have expected to find them caught
      among the &ldquo;shorts&rdquo; in Mexican rubber? It was Mexico, wasn't it, that these
      Rubber Consols purported to be connected with?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe's Company, upon its commercial merits, had not been considered at
      all by the gentlemen of the Stock Exchange, at the time of its flotation.
      Men vaguely and with difficulty recalled the fact of its prospectus, when
      the &ldquo;corner&rdquo; in its shares was first talked about. They looked it up in
      their lists and files, later on, but its terms said nothing to them.
      Nobody discussed the value of the assets owned by this Company, or the
      probability of its paying a dividend&mdash;even when the price bid for its
      shares was making the most sensational upward leaps. How Thorpe stood with
      his shareholders, or whether he had any genuine shareholders behind him at
      all, was seen by the keen eyes of Capel Court to be beside the question.
      Very likely it was a queer affair, if the truth were known&mdash;but at
      least it had substance enough in it to be giving the &ldquo;wreckers&rdquo; a lively
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of July it was understood that the fight was better worth
      watching than anything that had been seen in a long time. The only trouble
      was that there was so little to see. The papers said nothing. The
      sufferers were the reverse of garrulous. The little red Scotchman, Semple,
      who was the visible avenging sword of the &ldquo;corner,&rdquo; was more imperturbably
      silent than anybody else. His fellow-members in the &ldquo;House&rdquo; watched him
      now, however, with a new respect. They discovered unsuspected elements of
      power in his thin, tight mouth, in the direct, cold glances of his
      brown-grey eyes, in the very way he carried his head and wore his hat. He
      came to be pointed out, and nodded about behind his back, more than anyone
      else in the &ldquo;House,&rdquo; and important men sought his acquaintance, with an
      awkward show of civility, who were notorious for their rude exclusiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be, of course, that his &ldquo;corner&rdquo; would break under him at any
      fortnightly settlement, but already he had carried it much further than
      such things often went, and the planning of the coup had been beyond doubt
      Napoleonic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had this small sandy Scot planned it, or was he merely the weapon in
      Thorpe's hand? Both views had their supporters on the Exchange, but after
      the wrench of August 1st, when with an abrupt eighty-shilling rise the
      price of Rubber Consols stood at 15 pounds, and it was to be computed that
      Semple had received on that single day nearly 75,000 pounds in differences
      and &ldquo;backwardation,&rdquo; a story was set afloat which gave Thorpe the
      undivided credit of the invention. It was related as coming from his own
      lips that he had schemed it all out to be revenged upon a group of Jewish
      operators, against whom he had a grievance. In confirmation of this tale,
      it was pointed out that, of the seven men still held pinned in the fatal
      &ldquo;corner,&rdquo; six were Jews&mdash;and this did, upon first glance, look
      significant. But then it was objected, upon reflection, that Blaustein and
      Ascher had both been permitted to make their escape, and this hardly
      justified the theory of an implacable anti-Semitic vendetta. The objection
      seemed reasonable, but it was met in turn by the point that Blaustein and
      Ascher had been bled white, as Bismarck's phrase went, before they were
      released, whereas the five Christians had been liberated with relatively
      moderate fines. Upon the whole, a certain odour of the Judenhetze clung
      thereafter about the &ldquo;corner&rdquo; in Rubber Consols.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an afternoon of the following week, Mr. Stormont Thorpe was alone in
      the Board Room of the offices in Austin Friars. He had risen from the
      great roller-topped desk over between the windows, and walked now with a
      lethargic, tired step to and fro before the empty fireplace, yawning more
      than once, and stretching out his arms in the supreme gesture of fatigue.
      After a dozen listless rounds, something occurred to him. He moved with a
      certain directness of purpose to the cabinet in the corner, unlocked it,
      and poured out for himself a tumbler of brandy and soda. He drank it
      without a pause, then turned again, and began pacing up and down as
      before, his hands clasped behind him, his head bent in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intervening six months had effected visible changes in the outer man.
      One noted most readily that the face had grown fuller in its lower parts,
      and was far less browned than formerly. The large, heavy countenance, with
      its square jaws masked now under increased flesh, its beginnings of a
      double-chin, and its slightly flabby effect of pallor, was no longer
      lacking in individual distinction. It was palpably the visage of a
      dictator. The moustache had been cut down to military brevity, and the
      line of mouth below it was eloquent of rough power. The steady grey eyes,
      seemingly smaller yet more conspicuous than before, revealed in their
      glance new elements of secretiveness, of strategy supported by abundant
      and confident personal force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man himself seemed scarcely to have grown stouter. He held himself
      more compactly, as it were; seemed more the master of all his physical
      expressions. He was dressed like a magnate who was also a person of taste.
      There was a flower in the lapel of his well-shaped frock-coat, and the
      rustle of his starched and spotless white waistcoat murmured pleasantly of
      refined toilets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis of Chaldon&mdash;and a gentleman, with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The announcement, from a clerk who had noiselessly opened the door,
      imposed itself with decorum upon Thorpe's reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the gentleman with him?&rdquo; Thorpe began austerely to ask, after an
      instant's hesitation. But this briefest of delays had brought the callers
      into plain view behind the clerk, and with a slight gesture the master
      assented to their entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This large apartment was no longer called the Board Room by anybody. By
      tacit processes, it had become Mr. Thorpe's room. Not even the titular
      Chairman of the Company, the renowned and eminent Lord Chaldon,
      ex-Ambassador and ex-Viceroy, entered this chamber now with any assumption
      of proprietorship in it. No hint of a recollection that there were such
      things as the Company and the Board, or that he was nominally the head of
      both, expressed itself in his Lordship's demeanour as he advanced, his
      hand a little extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noble Chairman was white of beard and hair, and extremely courteous of
      manner&mdash;a small, carefully-clad, gracious old gentleman, whose mild
      pink countenance had, with years of anxiety about ways and means, disposed
      itself in lines which produced a chronic expression of solicitude. A
      nervous affection of the eyelids lent to this look, at intervals, a
      beseeching quality which embarrassed the beholder. All men had liked him,
      and spoken well of him throughout his long and hard-worked career. Thorpe
      was very fond of him indeed, and put a respectful cordiality into his
      grasp of the proffered hand. Then he looked, with a certain thinly-veiled
      bluntness of enquiry, past the Marquis to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were very kind to give me the appointment,&rdquo; said Lord Chaldon, with a
      little purring gloss of affability upon the earnestness of his tone. &ldquo;I
      wish very much to introduce to you my friend, my old friend I may say,
      Monsieur Alexandre Fromentin. We slept together under the same tent, in
      the Persian country beyond Bagdad&mdash;oh, it must have been quite forty
      years ago. We were youngsters looking to win our first spurs then&mdash;I
      in my line, he in his. And often since we have renewed that old friendship&mdash;at
      many different places&mdash;India, and Constantinople, and Egypt. I wish
      heartily to commend him to your&mdash;your kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had perfunctorily shaken hands with the stranger&mdash;a tall,
      slender, sharp-faced, clean-shaven, narrow-shouldered man, who by these
      accounts of his years ought not to have such excessively black hair. He
      bowed in a foreign fashion, and uttered some words which Thorpe, though he
      recognized them as English in intent, failed to follow. The voice was that
      of an elderly man, and at a second glance there were plenty of proofs that
      he might have been older than the Marquis, out there in Persia, forty
      years ago. But Thorpe did not like old men who dyed their hair, and he
      offered his visitors chairs, drawn up from the table toward his desk, with
      a certain reserve of manner. Seating himself in the revolving chair at the
      desk itself, he put the tips of his fingers together, and looked this
      gentleman with the Continental name and experience in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there something you wish me to do?&rdquo; he asked, passively facilitating
      the opening of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my God! 'Something'!&rdquo;&mdash;repeated the other, with a fluttering
      gesture of his hands over his thin, pointed knees&mdash;&ldquo;everything, Mr.
      Thorpe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a tolerably large order, isn't it?&rdquo; Thorpe asked, calmly, moving a
      slow, inscrutable glance from one to the other of his callers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could ask for nothing that would be a greater personal favour&mdash;and
      kindness&rdquo;&mdash;Lord Chaldon interposed. His tone bore the stress of
      sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means a great deal to me, as you know, my Lord,&rdquo; replied Thorpe,
      &ldquo;but I don't in the least understand&mdash;what is it that your friend
      wants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that I shall not be buried in a bankrupt's grave,&rdquo; the suppliant
      answered, with a kind of embittered eagerness of utterance. &ldquo;That I shall
      not see disgraced the honoured name that my father and his father
      bequeathed to my care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe's large, composed countenance betrayed a certain perplexity. &ldquo;There
      must be a mistake,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I don't even know this name of yours. I
      never heard it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other's mobile face twisted itself in a grimace of incredulity. He had
      a conspicuously wide mouth, and its trick of sidelong extension at this
      moment was very unpleasant. &ldquo;Ah, Herr Je! He never heard it,&rdquo; he
      ejaculated, turning nervously to the Marquis. &ldquo;Would to the good God you
      never had!&rdquo; he told Thorpe, with suppressed excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Chaldon, his own voice shaken a little, interposed with an
      explanation. &ldquo;My friend is the head&mdash;the respected head&mdash;of the
      firm of Fromentin Brothers. I think you have&mdash;have dealings with
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe, after a furtive instant of bewilderment, opened his mouth. &ldquo;Oh! I
      see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know what you mean now. With the French pronunciation, I
      didn't recognize the name. I've always heard it called 'Fromen'-tin' here
      in London. Oh, yes, of course&mdash;Fromen'tin Brothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips shut tight again at this. The listeners had caught no helpful
      clue from the tone of his words. They exchanged a glance, and then M.
      Fromentin spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Thorpe,&rdquo; he began, slowly, with an obvious effort at self-repression.
      &ldquo;It is a very simple story. Our house is an old one. My father's
      grandfather organized the finance of the commissariat of General Bonaparte
      in Egypt. He created the small beginnings of the carpet and rug
      importation from Asia Minor. His son, and in turn his son, followed him.
      They became bankers as well as importers. They helped very greatly to
      develop the trade of the Levant. They were not avaricious men, or usurers.
      It is not in our blood. Your Chairman, Lord Chaldon, who honours me so
      highly by calling me his friend&mdash;he will assure you that we have a
      good name in the East. Our banks have befriended the people, and never
      oppressed or injured them. For that reason&mdash;I will say perhaps for
      that reason&mdash;we have never become a very rich house. It is possible
      to name bankers who have made large fortunes out of Egypt. It was
      different with us. Lord Chaldon will tell you that of our own free will&mdash;my
      two brothers and I&mdash;of our own choice we consented to lose a fifth of
      all our possessions, rather than coin into gold by force the tears and
      blood of the wretched fellaheen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have never known a more honourable or humane action,&rdquo; put in
      the Marquis, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then my brothers die&mdash;Polydor, who lived mostly at Smyrna, and
      whose estate was withdrawn from the business by his widow, and Augustin,
      who lived here in London after 1870, and died&mdash;it is now six years
      ago. He left a son, Robert, who is my nephew, and my partner. He is now of
      an age&mdash;perhaps thirty years. He was a small child when he came to
      London&mdash;he has become more English than the English themselves. His
      activity and industry are very great; he forms plans of such magnitude and
      numbers that they would compel his grandfather to turn in his coffin. I am
      in indifferent health. I live much at Homburg and Marienbad and at Cairo.
      Practically speaking, I have retired from business. There remain branches
      of our house&mdash;in several places&mdash;but the London house has become
      the centre of all things&mdash;and Robert has become the London house.
      This I make plain to your mind, do I, Mr. Thorpe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other, with his chin sunk within the collar of his white waistcoat,
      and scrutinizing the narrator with a steadfast though impassive glance,
      made the faintest possible nod of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had great confidence in Robert,&rdquo; the old man went on. His eyes were
      dimming with tears, and his voice quavered uncertainly. &ldquo;His plans seemed
      wise, even if they risked more than formerly. The conditions of business
      are wholly altered since my youth&mdash;and it was best, I thought, to
      make Robert free to act under these conditions, which he understood much
      better than I could pretend to do. Thus it was that when he said it was
      necessary for Fromentin Brothers to belong to the Stock Exchange, I did
      not object. He was active and bold and clever, and he was in the thick of
      the fight. Therefore he should be the judge in all things. And that is our
      ruin. In the time of the South African excitement, he won a great deal of
      money. Then he lost it all and more. Then gambling began, and his fortunes
      went now up, now down, but always, as his books show to me now&mdash;sinking
      a little on the average. He grew more adventurous&mdash;more careless. He
      put many small counters upon different numbers on the table. You know what
      I mean? And in an accursed moment, because other gamblers were doing the
      same, he sold two thousand of your shares, without having them in his
      hands. Voila! He wishes now to put a bullet through his brain. He proposes
      that as the fitting end of Fromentin Freres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe, his chin on his breast, continued to regard the melancholy figure
      opposite with a moody eye. It seemed a long minute before he broke the
      tense silence by a sigh of discomfort. &ldquo;I do not discuss these things with
      anybody,&rdquo; he said then, coldly. &ldquo;If I had known who you were, I don't
      think you'd have got in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis of Chaldon intuitively straightened himself in his chair, and
      turned toward the speaker a glance of distressed surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or no&mdash;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; Thorpe hastened to add, upon the instant
      hint of this look&mdash;&ldquo;that doesn't convey my meaning. Of course, our
      Chairman brings whom he pleases. His friends&mdash;as a matter of course&mdash;are
      our friends. What I should have said was that if this had been mentioned
      beforehand to me, I should have explained that it wasn't possible to
      discuss that particular business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;pardon me&rdquo;&mdash;said Lord Chaldon, in a quiet, very gentle,
      yet insistent voice, which seemed now to recall to its listeners the fact
      that sovereigns and chancellors had in their day had attentive ears for
      its tones&mdash;&ldquo;pardon me, but why should it not be possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe frowned doubtfully, and shifted his position in his chair. &ldquo;What
      could I say, if it were discussed?&rdquo; he made vague retort. &ldquo;I'm merely one
      of the Directors. You are our Chairman, but you see he hasn't found it of
      any use to discuss it with you. There are hard and fast rules about these
      things. They run their natural course. You are not a business man, my Lord&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think I may be called a 'business man,'&rdquo; interposed the nobleman,
      suavely. &ldquo;They would tell you so in Calcutta, I think, and in Cairo too.
      When one considers it, I have transacted a great deal of business&mdash;on
      the behalf of other people. And if you will permit me&mdash;I do not
      impute indirection, of course&mdash;but your remark seems to require a
      footnote. It is true that I am Chairman of the Board on which you are a
      Director&mdash;but it is not quite the whole truth. I as Chairman know
      absolutely nothing about this matter. As I understand the situation, it is
      not in your capacity as a Director that you know anything about it either.
      Yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, as if suddenly conscious of some impropriety in this domestic
      frankness before a third party, and Thorpe pounced through his
      well-mannered hesitation with the swiftness of a bird of prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me suggest,&rdquo; he said roundly, lifting his head and poising a hand to
      hold attention, while he thought upon what it was he should suggest&mdash;&ldquo;this
      is what I would say. It seems rather irregular, doesn't it? to debate the
      matter in the presence of an outsider. You see it yourself. That is partly
      what I meant. Now I have met Mr. Fromentin,&rdquo; he gave the name its English
      vowels with an obstinate emphasis, &ldquo;and I have heard his statement. You
      have heard it too. If he wishes to lay more facts before us, why, well and
      good. But then I would suggest that he leave the matter in our hands, to
      discuss and look into between ourselves. That seems to you the proper
      course, doesn't it, Lord Chaldon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The French banker had been studying with strained acuteness the big
      lymphatic mask of the Director, with sundry sharp glances aside at the
      Chairman. The nervous changes on his alert, meagre old face showed how
      intently he followed every phase of their talk. A certain sardonic
      perception of evil in the air curled on his lip when he saw the Marquis
      accede with a bow and wave of the hand to Thorpe's proposition. Then he
      made his bow in turn, and put the best face possible upon the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally I consult your convenience&mdash;and the proprieties,&rdquo; he said,
      with an effect of proud humility. &ldquo;There are but a few other facts to
      submit. My nephew has already paid, in differences upon those accursed two
      thousand shares, a sum of nearly 30,000 pounds. I have the figures in my
      pocket&mdash;but they are fixed in my head as well. Twenty-eight thousand
      five hundred, those differences already amount to, not to speak of
      interest. At the last settlement, August 1st, the price per share was 15
      pounds. That would make 30,000 pounds more, if we bought now&mdash;or a
      total of practically 60,000 pounds. Eh bien! I beg for the privilege of
      being allowed to buy these shares now. It is an unpleasant confession to
      make, but the firm of Fromentin Freres will be made very poor by this loss
      of 60,000 pounds. It was not always so, but it is so now. My nephew Robert
      has brought it into that condition. You see my shame at this admission.
      With all my own means, and with his sister's marriage portion, we can make
      up this sum of 30,000 pounds, and still enable the firm to remain in
      existence. I have gone over the books very painstakingly, since I arrived
      in London. It can be kept afloat, and it can be brought back to safe and
      moderately profitable courses&mdash;if nothing worse happens. With another
      six weeks like the last, this will not be at all possible. We shall have
      the cup of dishonour thrust between our teeth. That will be the end of
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Fromentin finished in tremulous, grave tones. After looking with
      blurred eyes for a moment into Thorpe's face, he bowed his head, and
      softly swayed the knees upon which his thin, dark hands maintained their
      clutch. Not even the revelation of hair quite white at the roots, unduly
      widening the track of parting on the top of his dyed head, could rob this
      movement of its mournful dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe, after a moment's pause, took a pencil and paper from the desk, and
      made a calculation. He bit his lips and frowned at the sight of these
      figures, and set down some others, which seemed to please him no more.
      Then, with a sudden gesture as of impatience, he rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much is that sister's marriage portion you spoke of?&rdquo; he asked,
      rather brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French gentleman had also risen. He looked with an air of astonishment
      at his questioner, and then hardened his face. &ldquo;I apologize for mentioning
      it,&rdquo; he said, with brevity. &ldquo;One does not speak of family affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you how much it was,&rdquo; pursued Thorpe, in a masterful tone. &ldquo;A man
      doesn't want to rob a girl of her marriage portion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I must not answer you,&rdquo; the other replied, hesitatingly. &ldquo;It was
      the fault of my emotion to introduce the subject. Pray leave the young
      lady out of account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I've nothing more to say,&rdquo; Thorpe declared, and seated himself again
      with superfluous energy. He scowled for a little at the disorder of his
      desk, and then flung forth an angry explanation. &ldquo;If you evade fair
      questions like that, how can you expect that I will go out of my way to
      help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, permit me, Mr. Thorpe&rdquo;&mdash;the Marquis intervened soothingly&mdash;&ldquo;I
      think you misapprehend. My friend, I am sure, wished to evade nothing. He
      had the idea that he was at fault in&mdash;in alluding to a purely
      domestic matter as&mdash;as a&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;as a plea for
      your consideration.&rdquo; He turned to the old banker. &ldquo;You will not refuse to
      mention the sum to me, will you, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Fromentin shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It is ten thousand pounds,&rdquo; he
      replied, almost curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe was seemingly mollified. &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will sell
      you 2,000 shares at ten pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The others exchanged a wondering look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; the banker stammered&mdash;&ldquo;I see your meaning. You will
      forgive me&mdash;it is very well meant indeed by you&mdash;but it was not
      my proposition. The market-price is fifteen pounds&mdash;and we were
      prepared to pay it.&rdquo; Thorpe laughed in a peremptory, gusty way. &ldquo;But you
      can't pay more than I ask!&rdquo; he told him, with rough geniality. &ldquo;Come, if I
      let you and your nephew in out of the cold, what kind of men-folk would
      you be to insist that your niece should be left outside? As I said, I
      don't want her money. I don't want any woman's money. If I'm going to be
      nice to the rest of the family, what's the objection to my being nice to
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the Frenchman, after an instant's reflection, &ldquo;I offer
      none. I did not at the moment perceive the spirit of your words, but I
      recognize now that it was delicacy itself. I tender you the most profound
      thanks&mdash;for ALL the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some further conversation the elder Fromentin took his departure.
      Lord Chaldon apparently proposed to accompany him, but Thorpe begged him
      to remain, and he put aside his hat once more and resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe walked about a little, with his hands in his pockets, in a restless
      way. &ldquo;If it isn't unpleasant to you, I think I'll light a cigar,&rdquo; he said
      suddenly, and moved over to the cabinet. He poured out a drink of neat
      brandy, as well, and furtively swallowed it. Then he came back, preceded
      by a cloud of smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It went terribly against the grain,&rdquo; he said, with a rueful laugh. &ldquo;I'd
      sworn to let no Jew off with an inch of hide left on him&mdash;and here
      three of them have been wheedled out of my grip already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jews?&rdquo; exclaimed the Marquis, much puzzled. &ldquo;Did you&mdash;did you think
      Fromentin was a Jew? God bless me! he's no more one than I am! Why, not
      even so much, for there IS a Herschell in my pedigree. Why, dear man, they
      were Crusaders!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe smiled somewhat sheepishly. &ldquo;I never noticed much,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
      was a foreign-looking name. I took it for granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Chaldon bent his brows a little. &ldquo;Yes-s&rdquo;&mdash;he murmured,
      meditatively. &ldquo;I've heard it mentioned that your enterprise was suspected
      of an anti-Semitic twist. Do you mind my talking a little with you about
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all,&rdquo; the other answered with languid acquiescence, as he
      seated himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      LORD CHALDON'S instructive little monologue on the subject of the Hebrew
      in finance afforded Thorpe a certain pleasure, which was in its character,
      perhaps, more social than intellectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was both a flattering and striking experience to have so eminent a man
      at the side of one's desk, revealing for one's guidance the secrets of
      sovereigns and cabinets. Great names were mentioned in the course of this
      dissertation&mdash;mentioned with the authoritative ease of one who dined
      with princes and prime ministers&mdash;and Thorpe felt that he shared in
      the distinction of this familiarity with the august. He was in the
      position of paying a salary to this courtly old nobleman and statesman,
      who could tell him of his own intimate knowledge how Emperors conversed
      with one another; how the Pope fidgeted in his ornate-carved chair when
      the visitor talked on unwelcome topics; how a Queen and an opera-bouffe
      dancer waged an obscure and envenomed battle for the possession of a
      counting-house strong box, and in the outcome a nation was armed with
      inferior old muskets instead of modern weapons, and the girl got the
      difference expressed in black pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      These reminiscences seemed to alter the atmosphere, and even the
      appearance, of the Board Room. It was almost as if the apartment itself
      was becoming historic, like those chambers they pointed out to the tourist
      wherein crowned heads had slept. The manner of the Marquis lent itself
      charmingly to this illusion. He spoke in a facile, mellifluous voice, and
      as fluently as if he had been at work for a long time preparing a
      dissertation on this subject, instead of taking it up now by chance. In
      his tone, in his gestures, in the sustained friendliness of his facial
      expressions, there was a palpable desire to please his auditor&mdash;and
      Thorpe gave more heed to this than to the thread of the discourse. The
      facts that he heard now about the Jewish masters of international finance
      were doubtless surprising and suggestive to a degree, but somehow they
      failed to stimulate his imagination. Lord Chaldon's statesmanlike
      discussion of the uses to which they put this vast power of theirs; his
      conviction that on the whole they were beneficent; his dread of the
      consequences of any organized attempt to take this power away from them,
      and put it into other and less capable hands&mdash;no doubt it was all
      very clever and wise, but Thorpe did not care for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end he nodded, and, with a lumbering movement, altered his position
      in his chair. The fixed idea of despoiling Rostocker, Aronson, Ganz,
      Rothfoere, Lewis, and Mendel of their last sixpence had been in no wise
      affected by this entertaining homily. There appeared to be no need of
      pretending that it had been. If he knew anything of men and their manners,
      his titled friend would not object to a change of topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Chaldon,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;we've talked enough about general
      matters. While you're here, we might as well go into the subject of the
      Company. Our annual meeting is pretty nearly due&mdash;but I think it
      would be better to have it postponed. You see, this extraordinary
      development of dealing in our shares on the Stock Exchange has occupied my
      entire attention. There has been no time for arranging the machinery of
      operations on our property in Mexico. It's still there; it's all right.
      But for the time being, the operations in London are so much more
      important. We should have nothing to tell our shareholders, if we brought
      them together, except that their one-pound shares are worth fifteen
      pounds, and they know that already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis had listened with a shrewdly attentive eye upon the speaker's
      face. The nervous affection of his eyelids gave him now a minute of
      blinking leisure in which to frame his comment. &ldquo;I have not heard that my
      shares are worth fifteen pounds,&rdquo; he said then, with a direct, meaning
      little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Thorpe laughed, leaning comfortably back in his chair. &ldquo;That's what
      I want to talk to you about. You see, when the Company was started, it was
      impossible to foresee that this dealing in our ordinary shares would swamp
      everything else. If things had taken their usual course, and we had paid
      our attention to Mexico instead of to the London Stock Exchange, my
      deferred vendor's shares, two thousand of which you hold, would by this
      time be worth a good bit. As it is, unfortunately, they are outside of the
      deal. They have nothing to do with the movement of the ordinary shares.
      But of course you understand all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Chaldon assented by an eloquent nod, at once resigned and hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;that is contrary to all my expectations&mdash;and intentions,&rdquo;
       Thorpe resumed. &ldquo;I don't want you to suffer by this unlooked-for change in
      the shape of things. You hold two thousand shares&mdash;only by accident
      they're the wrong kind of shares. Very well: I'll make them the right kind
      of shares. I'll have a transfer sent to you tomorrow, so that you can
      return those vendor's shares to me, and in exchange for them I'll give you
      two thousand fully-paid ordinary shares. You can sell these at once, if
      you like, or you can hold them on over one more settlement, whichever you
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very munificent,&rdquo; remarked Lord Chaldon, after an instant's
      self-communion. His tone was extremely gracious, but he displayed none of
      the enthusiastic excitement which Thorpe perceived now that he had looked
      for. The equanimity of Marquises, who were also ex-Ambassadors, was
      evidently a deeper-rooted affair than he had supposed. This elderly and
      urbane diplomat took a gift of thirty thousand pounds as he might have
      accepted a superior cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brief pause ensued, and was ended by another remark from the nobleman:
      &ldquo;I thought for the moment of asking your advice&mdash;on this question of
      selling,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;But it will be put more appropriately, perhaps,
      in this way: Let me leave it entirely in your hands. Whatever you do will
      be right. I know so little of these things&mdash;and you know so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe put out his lips a trifle, and looked away for an instant in
      frowning abstraction. &ldquo;If it were put in that way&mdash;I think I should
      sell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's all right for me to take long chances&mdash;it's my
      game&mdash;but there's no reason why you should risk things. But let me
      put it in still another way,&rdquo; he added, with the passing gleam of a new
      thought over the dull surface of his eye. &ldquo;What do you say to our making
      the transaction strictly between ourselves? Here are shares to bearer, in
      the safe there. I say that two thousand of them are yours: that makes them
      yours. I give you my cheque for thirty thousand pounds&mdash;here, now, if
      you like&mdash;and that makes them mine again. The business is finished
      and done with&mdash;inside this room. Neither of us is to say anything
      about it to a soul. Does that meet your views?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The diplomat pondered the proposition&mdash;again with a lengthened
      perturbation of the eyelids. &ldquo;It would be possible to suggest a variety of
      objections, if one were of a sophistical turn of mind,&rdquo; he said at last,
      smilingly reflective. &ldquo;Yet I see no really insuperable obstacle in the
      path.&rdquo; He thought upon it further, and went on with an enquiring upward
      glance directed suddenly at Thorpe: &ldquo;Is there likely to be any very
      unpleasant hubbub in the press&mdash;when it is known that the annual
      meeting has been postponed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe shook his head with confidence. &ldquo;No&mdash;you need have no fear of
      that. The press is all right. It's the talk of the City, I'm told&mdash;the
      way I've managed the press. It isn't often that a man has all three of the
      papers walking the same chalk-line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis considered these remarks with a puzzled air. Then he smiled
      faintly. &ldquo;I'm afraid we're speaking of different things,&rdquo; he suggested.
      &ldquo;Apparently you refer to the financial papers. I had scarcely given them a
      thought. It does not seem to me that I should mind particularly what they
      said about me&mdash;but I should care a great deal about the other press&mdash;the
      great public press.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what do they know about these things?&rdquo; said Thorpe, lightly. &ldquo;So far
      as I can see, they don't know about anything, unless it gets into the
      police court, or the divorce court, or a court of some kind. They're the
      funniest sort of papers I ever saw. Seems as if they didn't think anything
      was safe to be printed until it had been sworn to. Why anybody should be
      afraid of them is more than I can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; persisted his Lordship, blandly, &ldquo;I should greatly dislike
      any public discussion of our Company's affairs. I hope it is quite clear
      that that can be avoided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; Thorpe told him, with reassuring energy. &ldquo;Why, discussions
      don't make themselves. Somebody has to kick before anything gets
      discussed. And who is to kick here? The public who hold the shares are not
      likely to complain because they've gone up fifteen hundred or two thousand
      per cent. And who else has any interest in what the Company, as a Company,
      does?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is a question which has occurred to me,&rdquo; said Lord Chaldon, &ldquo;and
      I shall be glad if it is already answered. The only people likely to
      'kick,' as you put it so simply, would be, I take it, Directors and other
      officers of the Company who find themselves holding a class of shares
      which does not participate in the present rise. I speak with some
      confidence&mdash;because I was in that position myself until a few minutes
      ago&mdash;and I don't mind confessing that I had brought myself to
      contemplate the contingency of ultimately being compelled to&mdash;to
      'kick' a little. Of course, so far as I am concerned, events have put me
      in a diametrically different frame of mind. If I came prepared&mdash;I
      won't say to curse, but to&mdash;to criticize&mdash;I certainly remain to
      bless. But you see my point. I of course do not know what you have done as
      regards the other members of the Board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care about them,&rdquo; said Thorpe, carelessly. &ldquo;You are the one that
      I wished to bring in on the ground-floor. The others don't matter. Of
      course, I shall do something for them; they shan't be allowed to make
      trouble&mdash;even supposing that it would be in their power to make
      trouble, which isn't the case. But it won't be done by any means on the
      same scale that&mdash;&rdquo; he paused abruptly, and the two men tacitly
      completed his sentence in the glance they exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis of Chaldon rose, and took up his hat and stick. &ldquo;If you will
      post it to me&mdash;in a registered letter&mdash;my town house&mdash;please,&rdquo;
       he remarked, with a charmingly delicate hesitation over the phrases. Then
      he put out his hand: &ldquo;I need not say how fully I appreciate your great
      kindness to my old friend Fromentin. It was a noble action&mdash;one I
      shall always reflect upon with admiration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won't mention it, though,&rdquo; said Thorpe, as they shook hands;
      &ldquo;either that or&mdash;or anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall preserve the most guarded&mdash;the most diplomatic secrecy,&rdquo; his
      Lordship assured him, as they walked toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe opened this door, and stepped aside, with a half bow, to facilitate
      the exit of the Marquis, who bent gracious acknowledgment of the courtesy.
      Then, with an abrupt start of surprise, the two men straightened
      themselves. Directly in front of them, leaning lightly against the
      brass-rail which guarded the entrance to the Board Room, stood Lord
      Plowden.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain sense of confusion, unwelcome but inevitable, visibly enveloped
      this chance meeting. The Marquis blinked very hard as he exchanged a
      fleeting hand-shake with the younger nobleman, and murmured some
      indistinguishable commonplaces. Then, with a graceful celerity, which was
      more than diplomatic, he disappeared. Thorpe, with more difficulty,
      recovered a sort of stolidity of expression that might pass for composure.
      He in turn gave his hand to the newcomer, and nodded to him, and achieved
      a doubtful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; he said, haltingly. &ldquo;Where did you drop from? Glad to see you!
      How are all your people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later the young Viscount was seated in the chair which the
      elderly Marquis had vacated. He presented therein a figure which, in its
      way, was perhaps as courtly as the other had been&mdash;but the way was
      widely different. Lord Plowden's fine, lithe form expressed no deference
      in its easy postures. His handsome face was at no pains to assume
      conciliatory or ingratiating aspects. His brilliant brown eyes sparkled a
      confident, buoyant gaze full into the heavy, lethargic countenance of the
      big man at the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't bothered you before,&rdquo; he said, tossing his gloves into his hat,
      and spreading his frock-coat out by its silk lapels. He crossed his legs,
      and sat back with a comfortable smile. &ldquo;I knew you were awfully busy&mdash;and
      I kept away as long as I could. But now&mdash;well, the truth is&mdash;I'm
      in rather of a hole. I hope you don't mind my coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not at all,&rdquo; said Thorpe, laconically. After a momentary pause he
      added: &ldquo;The Marquis has just been consulting me about the postponement of
      the annual meeting. I suppose you agree with us&mdash;that it would be
      better to put it off. There's really nothing to report. Of course, you
      know more about the situation than he does&mdash;between ourselves. The
      shareholders don't want a meeting; it's enough for them that their shares
      are worth fifteen or twenty times what they paid for them. And certainly
      WE don't need a meeting, as things stand now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes&mdash;how do things stand now?&rdquo; asked Lord Plowden, briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;&mdash;Thorpe eyed his visitor with a moody blankness of gaze, his
      chin once more buried in his collar&mdash;&ldquo;well, everything is going all
      right, as far as I can see. But, of course, these dealings in our shares
      in the City have taken up all my time&mdash;so that I haven't been able to
      give any attention to starting up work in Mexico. That being the case, I
      shall arrange to foot all the bills for this year's expenses&mdash;the
      rent, the Directors' fees and clerk-hire and so on&mdash;out of my own
      pocket. It comes, all told, to about 2,700 pounds&mdash;without counting
      my extra 1,000 pounds as Managing Director. I don't propose to ask for a
      penny of that, under the circumstances&mdash;and I'll even pay the other
      expenses. So that the Company isn't losing a penny by our not getting to
      work at the development of the property. No one could ask anything fairer
      than that.&mdash;And are your mother and sister quite well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well indeed, thanks,&rdquo; replied the other. He relapsed abruptly
      into a silence which was plainly preoccupied. Something of the radiant
      cheerfulness with which his face had beamed seemed to have faded away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in treaty for a house and a moor in the Highlands&rdquo;&mdash;Thorpe went
      on, in a casual tone&mdash;&ldquo;in fact, I'm hesitating between three or four
      places that all seem to be pretty good&mdash;but I don't know whether I
      can get away much before the twentieth. I hope you can contrive to come
      while I'm there. I should like it very much if you would bring your mother
      and sister&mdash;and your brother too. I have a nephew about his age&mdash;a
      fine young fellow&mdash;who'd be company for him. Why can't you say now
      that you'll all come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden emerged from his brown study with the gleam of some new idea
      on his face. &ldquo;I might bring my sister,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My mother hates
      Scotland. She doesn't go about, either, even in England. But I daresay
      Winnie would enjoy it immensely. She has a great opinion of you, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only saw her that once,&rdquo; Thorpe remarked. Some thought behind his words
      lent a musing effect to the tone in which they were uttered. The brother's
      contemplative smile seemed a comment upon this tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women are curious creatures,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They take fancies and dislikes as
      swiftly and irresponsibly as cloud-shadows shift and change on a
      mountain-side in April. But I happen to know that my sister does like you
      immensely. So does my mother,&rdquo; he added, with another little smile. He
      continued to regard Thorpe's face, but there was an increasing uncertainty
      in his glance. &ldquo;You've put on flesh, haven't you?&rdquo; he ventured, after a
      brief pause. There was the implication in his voice and manner that he
      observed changes which disconcerted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, I guess,&rdquo; replied the other, carelessly. &ldquo;I've been sticking to
      the City pretty closely. That's all. There's nothing that a fortnight's
      rest won't put right. I should like it first-rate to have you and your
      sister come. I'll let you know which place I decide upon. Very likely you
      can manage to bring her at the same time that some other ladies will be
      there. I expect Lady Cressage and Miss Madden, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden stared at his friend. &ldquo;Are they back? Have they returned to
      England?&rdquo; he asked, confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, didn't you know?&rdquo; Thorpe pursued, with an accession of amiability. He
      visibly had pleasure in the disclosure of the other's ignorance. &ldquo;They've
      been in London for two or three weeks. That is, Miss Madden has been
      taking flying trips to see cathedrals and so on, but Lady Cressage has
      stayed in town. Their long journeyings have rather done her up.&rdquo; He looked
      Plowden straight in the eye, and added with an air of deliberation: &ldquo;I'm
      rather anxious about her health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nobleman frankly abandoned his efforts to maintain an undisturbed
      front. &ldquo;You&mdash;are&mdash;anxious,&rdquo; he repeated, frowning in displeased
      wonderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes&mdash;why not?&rdquo; demanded Thorpe, with a sudden growl in his
      voice. As he covered the handsome Viscount with his heavy, intent gaze,
      impulses of wrath stirred within him. Why should this fop of a lordling
      put on this air of contemptuous incredulity? &ldquo;What is there so amazing
      about that? Why shouldn't I be anxious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peremptory harshness of his manner, and the scowl on his big, lowering
      face, brought a sort of self-control back to the other. He shrugged his
      shoulders, with an attempt at nonchalance. &ldquo;Why not indeed!&rdquo; he said, as
      lightly as he could. With hands on knees, he bent forward as if to rise.
      &ldquo;But perhaps I'd better come in another day,&rdquo; he suggested, tentatively.
      &ldquo;I'm interrupting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;sit still,&rdquo; Thorpe bade him, and then, with chin settled more
      determinedly than ever in his cravat, sat eyeing him in a long, dour
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden found it impossible to obtain from this massive, apathetic
      visage any clue to the thoughts working behind it. He chanced to recall
      the time when he had discussed with Thorpe the meaning and values of this
      inscrutable expression which the latter's countenance could assume. It had
      seemed interesting and even admirable to him then&mdash;but then he had
      not foreseen the possibility that he himself might some day confront its
      adamantine barrier with a sinking heart. All at once he could bear this
      implacable sphinx-gaze no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure some other day would be better,&rdquo; he urged, with an open overture
      to propitiation in his tone. &ldquo;You're not in the mood to be bothered with
      my affairs today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much today as any other,&rdquo; Thorpe answered him, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other sat suddenly upright&mdash;and then upon a moment's reflection
      rose to his feet. &ldquo;I don't in the least know what to make of all this,&rdquo; he
      said, with nervous precipitancy. &ldquo;If I've offended you in any way, say so,
      and I will apologize at once. But treatment of this sort passes my
      comprehension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe in truth did not himself comprehend it much more clearly. Some
      strange freak of wilfulness impelled him to pursue this unintelligible
      persecution. &ldquo;I've said nothing about any offense,&rdquo; he declared, in a
      hard, deliberate voice. &ldquo;It is your own word. All the same&mdash;I mention
      the name of a lady&mdash;a lady, mind you, whom I met under your own roof&mdash;and
      you strike attitudes and put on airs as if&mdash;as if I wasn't good
      enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, upon my word, that's all rubbish!&rdquo; the other broke in. &ldquo;Nothing could
      have been further from my thoughts, I assure you. Quite naturally I was
      surprised for the moment at a bit of unexpected news&mdash;but that was
      all. I give you my word that was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; Thorpe consented grudgingly to mutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued his sullen scrutiny of the man standing before him, noting
      how the vivacity of his bearing had deteriorated in these few minutes. He
      had cut such a gallant figure when he entered the room, with his sparkling
      eye and smile, his almost jaunty manner, his superior tailor's plumage&mdash;and
      now he was such a crestfallen and wilted thing! Remembering their last
      conversation together&mdash;remembering indeed how full of liking for this
      young nobleman he had been when they last met&mdash;Thorpe paused to
      wonder at the fact that he felt no atom of pity for him now. What was his
      grievance? What had Plowden done to provoke this savage hostility? Thorpe
      could not tell. He knew only that unnamed forces dragged him forward to
      hurt and humiliate his former friend. Obscurely, no doubt, there was
      something about a woman in it. Plowden had been an admirer of Lady
      Cressage. There was her father's word for it that if there had been money
      enough he would have wished to marry her. There had been, as well, the
      General's hint that if the difficulty of Plowden's poverty were removed,
      he might still wish to marry her&mdash;a hint which Thorpe discovered to
      be rankling with a sudden new soreness in his mind. Was that why he hated
      Plowden? No&mdash;he said to himself that it was not. He was going to
      marry Lady Cressage himself. Her letter, signifying delicately her assent
      to his proposal, had come to him that very morning&mdash;was in his pocket
      now. What did he care about the bye-gone aspirations of other would-be
      suitors? And, as for Plowden, he had not even known of her return to
      London. Clearly there remained no communications of any sort between them.
      It was not at all on her account, he assured himself, that he had turned
      against Plowden. But what other reason could there be? He observed his
      visitor's perturbed and dejected mien with a grim kind of satisfaction&mdash;but
      still he could not tell why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all terribly important to me,&rdquo; the nobleman said, breaking the
      unpleasant silence. His voice was surcharged with earnestness. &ldquo;Apparently
      you are annoyed with something&mdash;what it may be I can't for the life
      of me make out. All I can say is&rdquo;&mdash;and he broke off with a helpless
      gesture which seemed to imply that he feared to say anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe put out his lips. &ldquo;I don't know what you mean,&rdquo; he said, brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I mean&rdquo;&mdash;the other echoed, with bewildered vagueness of glance.
      &ldquo;I'm all at sea. I don't in the least grasp the meaning of anything. You
      yourself volunteered the declaration that you would do great things for
      me. 'We are rich men together'&mdash;those were your own words. I urged
      you at the time to go slowly&mdash;to consider carefully whether you
      weren't being too generous. I myself said to you that you were
      ridiculously exaggerating what you called your obligation to me. It was
      you who insisted upon presenting me with 100,000 shares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they are here ready for you,&rdquo; said Thorpe, with calculated
      coldness. &ldquo;You can have them whenever you please. I promised them to you,
      and set them aside for you. You can take them away with you now, if you
      like. What are you kicking up this fuss for, then? Upon my word!&mdash;you
      come here and suggest to me that I made promises to you which I've
      broken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plowden looked hard at him, as he turned over in his mind the purport of
      these words. &ldquo;I see what you are doing,&rdquo; he said then. &ldquo;You turn over to
      me 100,000 vendor's deferred shares. Thanks! I have already 1,000 of them.
      I keep them in the same box with my father's Confederate bonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the hell do you mean?&rdquo; Thorpe broke in with explosive warmth,
      lifting himself in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come now, Thorpe,&rdquo; Plowden retorted, &ldquo;let's get this talk on an
      intelligent, common-sense footing.&rdquo; He had regained something of his
      self-control, and keenly put forward now to help him all his persuasive
      graces of eye and speech. He seated himself once more. &ldquo;I'm convinced that
      you want to be good to me. Of course you do! If I've seemed here for a
      minute or two to think otherwise, it was because I misunderstood things.
      Don't let there be any further misunderstandings! I apologize for doing
      you the momentary injustice of suspecting that you were going to play off
      the vendor's shares on me. Of course you said it&mdash;but it was a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems to be a joke somewhere, sure enough,&rdquo; said Thorpe, in dryly
      metallic tones&mdash;&ldquo;but it isn't me who's the joker. I told you you
      should have 100,000 of my 400,000 shares, didn't I? I told you that in so
      many words. Very well, what more do you want? Here they are for you! I
      keep my promise to the letter. But you&mdash;you seem to think you're
      entitled to make a row. What do you mean by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little word&rdquo;&mdash;interposed Plowden, with strenuous calmness of
      utterance&mdash;&ldquo;what you say may be true enough&mdash;yes, I admit it is
      true as far as it goes. But was that what either of us had in our minds at
      the time? You know it wasn't! You had just planned a coup on the Stock
      Exchange which promised you immense rewards. I helped you to pass a bogus
      allotment through our Board&mdash;without which your coup wouldn't have
      been worth a farthing. You were enthusiastically grateful to me then. In
      the excitement of the moment you promised me a quarter of all you should
      make. 'WE ARE BOTH RICH MEN!' I remember those very words of yours. They
      have never been out of my mind. We discussed the things that we would each
      do, when we came into this wealth. It was taken for granted in all our
      talk that your making money meant also my making money. That was the
      complete understanding&mdash;here in London, and while you were at my
      house. You know it as well as I do. And I refuse to suppose that you
      seriously intend to sit there and pretend that you meant to give me
      nothing but an armful of waste paper. It would be too monstrous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe rapped with his nails on the desk, to point the force of his
      rejoinder: &ldquo;How do you account for the fact, my Lord&rdquo;&mdash;he gave his
      words a chillingly scornful precision of utterance&mdash;&ldquo;that I
      distinctly mentioned 400,000 vendor's shares of mine, 100,000 of which I
      promised to turn over to you? Those were the specific terms, were they
      not? You don't deny it? Then what are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I account for it in this way&rdquo;&mdash;said Plowden, after a moment's
      baffled reflection: &ldquo;at that time you yourself hadn't grasped the
      difference between the two classes of shares. You thought the vendor's
      shares would play a part in the game. Ah! I see I've hit the mark! That
      was the way of it!&mdash;And now here, Thorpe! Let all that's been said be
      bye-gones! I don't want any verbal triumph over you. You don't want to
      wrong me&mdash;and yourself too&mdash;by sticking to this quibble about
      vendor's shares. You intended to be deuced good to me&mdash;and what have
      I done that you should round on me now? I haven't bothered you before. I
      came today only because things are particularly rotten, financially, just
      now. And I don't even want to hold you to a quarter&mdash;I leave that
      entirely to you. But after all that's been said and done&mdash;I put it to
      you as one man to another&mdash;you are morally bound to help me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&mdash;'all that's been said and done'?&rdquo; Thorpe asked the
      question in some confusion of moods. Perhaps it was the ethical force of
      Lord Plowden's appeal, perhaps only a recurring sense of his earlier
      affection for the man&mdash;but for the moment he wavered in his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peer flushed a little, as he looked at the floor, revolving possible
      answers to this query. His ear had been quick to seize the note of
      hesitation in Thorpe's tone. He strove anxiously to get together
      considerations which should tip the fluttering balance definitely his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began slowly, &ldquo;I hardly know how to put it. Of course there
      was, in the first place, the immense expectation of fortune which you gave
      me, and which I'm afraid I've more than lived up to. And then, of course,
      others shared my expectations. It wasn't a thing one could very well keep
      to oneself. My mother and my sister&mdash;especially my sister&mdash;they
      were wonderfully excited about it. You are quite the hero in their eyes.
      And then&mdash;you remember that talk we had, in which you said I could
      help you&mdash;socially, you know. I did it a little, just as a start, but
      of course there's no end to what could be done. You've been too busy
      heretofore, but we can begin now whenever you like. I don't mind telling
      you&mdash;I've had some thoughts of a possible marriage for you. In point
      of blood and connections it would be such a match as a commoner hasn't
      made before in my memory&mdash;a highly-cultivated and highly-bred young
      lady of rank&mdash;and settlements could be made so that a considerable
      quantity of land would eventually come to your son. I needn't tell you
      that land stands for much more than money, if you happen to set your mind
      on a baronetcy or a peerage. Of course&mdash;I need scarcely say&mdash;I
      mention this marriage only as something which may or may not attract you,&mdash;it
      is quite open to you to prefer another,&mdash;but there is hardly anything
      of that sort in which I and my connections could not be of use to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even more by the tone and inflection of these words than by the phrases
      themselves, Thorpe divined that he was being offered the hand of the Hon.
      Winifred Plowden in marriage. He recalled vividly the fact that once the
      shadow of some such thought had floated through his own brain; there had
      been a moment&mdash;it seemed curiously remote, like a dream-phantom from
      some previous state of existence&mdash;when he had dwelt with personal
      interest upon her inheritance from long lines of noblemen, and her
      relation to half the peerage. Then, swiftly, illogically, he disliked the
      brother of this lady more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is talking in the air,&rdquo; he said, with abrupt decision. &ldquo;I see
      nothing in it. You shall have your vendor's shares, precisely as I
      promised you. I don't see how you can possibly ask for anything more.&rdquo; He
      looked at the other's darkling face for a moment, and then rose with
      unwieldy deliberation. &ldquo;If you're so hard up though,&rdquo; he continued,
      coldly, &ldquo;I don't mind doing this much for you. I'll exchange the thousand
      vendor's shares you already hold the ones I gave you to qualify you at the
      beginning&mdash;for ordinary shares. You can sell those for fifteen
      thousand pounds cash. In fact, I'll buy them of you now. I'll give you a
      cheque for the amount. Do you want it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden, red-faced and frowning, hesitated for a fraction of time.
      Then in constrained silence he nodded, and Thorpe, leaning ponderously
      over the desk, wrote out the cheque. His Lordship took it, folded it up,
      and put it in his pocket without immediate comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then this is the end of things, is it?&rdquo; he asked, after an awkward
      silence, in a voice he strove in vain to keep from shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things?&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plowden shrugged his shoulders, framed his lips to utter something which
      he decided not to say, and at last turned on his heel. &ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; he
      called out over his shoulder, and left the room with a flagrant air of
      hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe, wandering about the apartment, stopped after a time at the
      cabinet, and helped himself to a drink. The thing most apparent to him was
      that of set purpose he had converted a friend into an enemy. Why had he
      done this? He asked himself the question in varying forms, over his brandy
      and soda, but no convincing answer came. He had done it because he had
      felt like doing it. It was impossible to trace motives further than that.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EDITH will be down in a very few moments,&rdquo; Miss Madden assured Thorpe
      that evening, when he entered the drawing-room of the house she had taken
      in Grafton Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked into her eyes and smiled, as he bowed over the hand she extended
      to him. His glance expressed with forceful directness his thought: &ldquo;Ah,
      then she has told you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The complacent consciousness of producing a fine effect in evening-clothes
      had given to Mr. Stormont Thorpe habitually now a mildness of manner,
      after the dressing hour, which was lacking to his deportment in the
      day-time. The conventional attire of ceremony, juggled in the hands of an
      inspired tailor, had been brought to lend to his ponderous figure a
      dignity, and even something of a grace, which the man within assimilated
      and made his own. It was an equable and rather amiable Thorpe whom people
      encountered after nightfall&mdash;a gentleman who looked impressive enough
      to have powerful performances believed of him, yet seemed withal an
      approachable and easy-going person. Men who saw him at midnight or later
      spoke of him to their womenkind with a certain significant reserve, in
      which trained womankind read the suggestion that the &ldquo;Rubber King&rdquo; drank a
      good deal, and was probably not wholly nice in his cups.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, could not be said to render him less interesting in any
      eyes. There was indeed about it the implication of a generous nature, or
      at the least of a blind side&mdash;and it is not unpleasant to discover
      these attributes in a new man who has made his half-million, and has, or
      may have, countless favours to bestow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if his tongue instead of his eyes had uttered the exclamation&mdash;&ldquo;Ah,
      then she has told you!&rdquo;&mdash;for Miss Madden took it as having been
      spoken. &ldquo;I'm not disposed to pretend that I'm overjoyed about it, you
      know,&rdquo; she said to him bluntly, as their hands dropped, and they stood
      facing each other. &ldquo;If I said I congratulated you, it would be only the
      emptiest form. And I hate empty forms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you think that I won't make a good husband?&rdquo; Thorpe asked the
      question with a good-natured if peremptory frankness which came most
      readily to him in the presence of this American lady, herself so outspoken
      and masterful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that I specially doubt it,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I suppose any man
      has in him the makings of what is called a good husband&mdash;if the
      conditions are sufficiently propitious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then&mdash;what's the matter with the conditions?&rdquo; he demanded,
      jocosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Madden shrugged her shoulders slightly. Thorpe noted the somewhat
      luxuriant curves of these splendid shoulders, and the creamy whiteness of
      the skin, upon which, round the full throat, a chain of diamonds lay as
      upon satin&mdash;and recalled that he had not seen her before in what he
      phrased to himself as so much low-necked dress. The deep fire-gleam in her
      broad plaits of hair gave a wonderful brilliancy to this colouring of brow
      and throat and bosom. He marvelled at himself for discovering only now
      that she also was beautiful&mdash;and then thrilled with pride at the
      thought that henceforth his life might be passed altogether among
      beautiful women, radiant in gems and costly fabrics, who would smile upon
      him at his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have no wish to be a kill-joy,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I'm sure I hope all
      manner of good results from the&mdash;the experiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that's what it comes to,&rdquo; he said, meditatively. &ldquo;It's all an
      experiment. Every marriage in the world must be that&mdash;neither more
      nor less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all the experience of the ages against its coming out right.&rdquo; She
      had turned to move toward a chair, but looked now over her shoulder at
      him. &ldquo;Have you ever seen what seemed to you an absolutely happy marriage
      in your life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon reflection he shook his head. &ldquo;I don't recall one on the spur of the
      minute,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;Not the kind, I mean, that you read about in
      books. But I've seen plenty where the couple got along together in a good,
      easy, comfortable sort of way, without a notion of any sort of
      unpleasantness. It's people who marry too young who do most of the
      fighting, I imagine. After people have got to a sensible age, and know
      what they want and what they can get along without, why then there's no
      reason for any trouble. We don't start out with any school-boy and
      school-girl moonshine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there's a good deal to be said for the moonshine,&rdquo; she interrupted
      him, as she sank upon the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why certainly,&rdquo; he assented, amiably, as he stood looking down at her.
      &ldquo;The more there is of it, the better&mdash;if it comes naturally, and
      people know enough to understand that it is moonshine, and isn't the
      be-all and end-all of everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a lover for you!&rdquo; Miss Madden cried, with mirth and derision
      mingled in her laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you worry about me,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I'm a good enough lover, all
      right. And when you come to that, if Edith is satisfied, I don't precisely
      see what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business it is of mine?&rdquo; she finished the sentence for him. &ldquo;You're
      entirely right. As you say, IF she's satisfied, no one else has anything
      to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have you got any right to assume that she isn't satisfied?&rdquo; he asked
      her with swift directness&mdash;&ldquo;or any reason for supposing it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Madden shook her head, but the negation seemed qualified by the
      whimsical smile she gave him. &ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and on the
      instant the talk was extinguished by the entrance of Lady Cressage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe's vision was flooded with the perception of his rare fortune as he
      went to meet her. He took the hand she offered, and looked into the smile
      of her greeting, and could say nothing. Her beauty had gathered to it new
      forces in his eyes&mdash;forces which dazzled and troubled his glance. The
      thought that this exquisite being&mdash;this ineffable compound of feeling
      and fine nerves and sweet wisdom and wit and loveliness&mdash;belonged to
      him seemed too vast for the capacity of his mind. He could not keep
      himself from trembling a little, and from diverting to a screen beyond her
      shoulder a gaze which he felt to be overtly dimmed and embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have kept you waiting,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft sound of her voice came to his ears as from a distance. It bore
      an unfamiliar note, upon the strangeness of which he dwelt for a detached
      instant. Then its meaning broke in upon his consciousness from all sides,
      and lighted up his heavy face with the glow of a conqueror's self-centred
      smile. He bent his eyes upon her, and noted with a controlled exaltation
      how her glance in turn deferred to his, and fluttered beneath it, and
      shrank away. He squared his big shoulders and lifted his head. Still
      holding her jewelled hand in his, he turned and led her toward the sofa.
      Halting, he bowed with an exaggerated genuflection and flourish of his
      free hand to Miss Madden, the while he flashed at her a glance at once of
      challenge and of deprecation. Through the sensitized contact of the other
      hand, he felt that the woman he held bowed also, and in his own spirit of
      confused defiance and entreaty. The laugh he gave then seemed to dispel
      the awkwardness which had momentarily hung over the mocking salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Madden laughed too. &ldquo;Oh, I surrender,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You drag
      congratulations from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some quality in the tone of this ungracious speech had the effect of
      putting the party at its ease. Lady Cressage seated herself beside her
      friend on the sofa, and gently, abstractedly, patted one of her hands.
      Thorpe remained on his feet, looking down at the pair with satisfied
      cheerfulness. He tool, a slip of paper from his pocket, to support a
      statement he was making.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm forever telling you what a strain the City is on a man in my
      position,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;and today I had the curiosity to keep an account
      of what happened. Here it is. I had thirty callers. Of those, how many do
      you suppose came to see me on my own business? Just eight. That is to say,
      their errands were about investments of mine, but most of them managed to
      get in some word about axes of their own to grind. All the rest made no
      pretence at all of thinking about anybody but themselves. I've classified
      them, one by one, here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, there were six men who wanted me to take shares of one sort or
      another, and I had to more or less listen to what they tried to make out
      their companies were like. They were none of them any good. Eight
      different fellows came to me with schemes that haven't reached the company
      stage. One had a scheme for getting possession of a nigger republic in the
      West Indies by raising a loan, and then repudiating all the previous
      loans. Another wanted me to buy a paper for him, in which he was to
      support all my enterprises. Another wanted to start a bank&mdash;I
      apparently to find the money, and he the brains. One chap wanted me to
      finance a theatrical syndicate&mdash;he had a bag full of photographs of
      an actress all eyes and teeth and hair,&mdash;and another chap had a
      scheme all worked out for getting a concession from Spain for one of the
      Caroline Islands, and putting up a factory there for making porpoise-hide
      leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there were three inventors&mdash;let's see, here they are&mdash;one
      with a coiled wire spring for scissors inside a pocket-knife, and one with
      a bottle, the whole top of which unscrews instead of having a cork or
      stopper, and one with an electrical fish-line, a fine wire inside the
      silk, you know, which connects with some battery when a fish bites, and
      rings a bell, and throws out hooks in various directions, and does all
      sorts of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, there was a man who wanted me to take the chairmanship of a
      company, and one who wanted me to guarantee an overdraft at his bank, and
      two who wanted to borrow money on stock, and one parson-fellow who tried
      to stick me for a subscription to some Home or other he said he had for
      children in the country. He was the worst bounder of the lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's twenty-seven people&mdash;and twenty of them strangers to
      me, and not worth a penny to me, and all trying to get money out of me.
      Isn't that a dog's life for one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Miss Madden, contemplatively. &ldquo;A lady may have twice
      that number of callers in an afternoon&mdash;quite as great strangers to
      all intents and purposes&mdash;and not even have the satisfaction of
      discovering that they had any object whatever in calling. At least your
      people had some motive: the grey matter in their brain was working. And
      besides, one of them might have had something to say which you would
      value. I don't think that ever happens among a lady's callers; does it,
      Edith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edith smiled, pleasantly and yet a little wistfully, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; Thorpe went on, with a kind of purpose gathering in his
      eyes, &ldquo;none of those fellows cost me anything, except in time. But then I
      had three callers, almost in a bunch, and one of them took out of me
      thirty thousand pounds, and another fifteen thousand pounds, and the third&mdash;an
      utter stranger he was&mdash;he got an absolute gratuity of ten thousand
      pounds, besides my consent to a sale which, if I had refused it, would
      have stood me in perhaps forty or fifty thousand pounds more. You ladies
      may thank your stars you don't have that kind of callers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of these figures in the air brought a constrained look to the
      faces of the women. Seemingly they confronted a subject which was not to
      their liking. The American, however, after a moment's pause, took it up in
      an indifferent manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of an 'absolute gratuity.' I know nothing of London City
      methods&mdash;but isn't ten thousand pounds a gratuity on a rather large
      scale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe hesitated briefly, then smiled, and, with slow deliberation, drew
      up a chair and seated himself before them. &ldquo;Perhaps I don't mind telling
      you about it,&rdquo; he began, and paused again. &ldquo;I had a letter in my mail this
      morning,&rdquo; he went on at last, giving a sentimental significance to both
      tone and glance&mdash;&ldquo;a letter which changed everything in the world for
      me, and made me the proudest and happiest man above ground. And I put that
      letter in my pocket, right here on the left side&mdash;and it's there now,
      for that matter&rdquo;&mdash;he put his hand to his breast, as if under the
      impulse to verify his words by the production of the missive, and then
      stopped and flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies, watching him, seemed by their eyes to condone the mawkishness
      of the demonstration which had tempted him. There was indeed a kind of
      approving interest in their joint regard, which he had not experienced
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had it in my pocket,&rdquo; he resumed, with an accession of mellow emotion
      in his voice, &ldquo;and none of the callers ever got my thoughts very far from
      that letter. And one of these was an old man&mdash;a French banker who
      must be seventy years old, but dyes his hair a kind of purple black&mdash;and
      it seems that his nephew had got the firm into a terrible kind of scrape,
      selling 2,000 of my shares when he hadn't got them to sell and couldn't
      get them&mdash;and the old man came to beg me to let him out at present
      market figures. He got Lord Chaldon&mdash;he's my Chairman, you know&mdash;to
      bring him, and introduce him as his friend, and plead for him&mdash;but I
      don't think all that, by itself, would have budged me an atom. But then
      the old man told how he was just able to scrape together money enough to
      buy the shares he needed, at the ruling price, and he happened to mention
      that his niece's marriage portion would have to be sacrificed. Well, then,
      do you know, that letter in my pocket said something to me....And&mdash;well,
      that's the story. The girl' s portion, I wormed it out of him, was ten
      thousand...and I struck that much off the figure that I allowed him to buy
      his shares, and save his firm, for....It was all the letter that did it,
      mind you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He concluded the halting narrative amid a marked silence. The ladies
      looked at him and at each other, but they seemed surprised out of their
      facility of comment. In this kind of flustered hush, the door was opened
      and dinner was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Madden welcomed the diversion by rising with ostentatious vigour. &ldquo;I
      will take myself out,&rdquo; she declared, with cheerful promptness leading the
      way. Lady Cressage took the arm Thorpe offered her, and gave no token of
      comprehending that her wrist was being caressingly pressed against his
      side as they moved along.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the little table shining in the centre of the dark, cool dining-room,
      talk moved idly about among general topics. A thunderstorm broke over the
      town, at an early stage of the dinner, and the sound of the rushing
      downpour through the open windows, and the breath of freshness which
      stirred the jaded air, were pleasanter than any speech. Thoughts roved
      intuitively country-ward, where the long-needed rain would be dowering the
      landscape with new life&mdash;where the earth at sunrise would be green
      again, and buoyant in reawakened energy, and redolent with the perfumes of
      sweetest summer. They spoke of the fields and the moors with the longing
      of tired town-folk in August.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, when I get away&rdquo;&mdash;said Thorpe, fervently, &ldquo;it seems to me that I
      don't want ever to come back. These last few weeks have got terribly on my
      nerve. And really&mdash;why should I come back? I've been asking myself
      the question&mdash;more today than ever before. Of course everything has
      been different today. But if I'm to get any genuine good out of my&mdash;my
      fortune&mdash;I must pull away from the City altogether sometime&mdash;and
      why not now? Of course, some important things are still open&mdash;and
      they have to be watched night and day&mdash;but after all, Semple&mdash;that's
      my Broker&mdash;he could do it for me. At the most, it won't last more
      than another six weeks. There is a settlement-day next week, the 15th, and
      another a fortnight after, on the 29th, and another on September 12th.
      Well, those three days, if they're worked as I intend they shall be, and
      nothing unforeseen happens, will bring in over four hundred thousand
      pounds, and close the 'corner' in Rubber Consols for good. Then I need
      never see the City again, thank God! And for that matter&mdash;why, what
      is six weeks? It's like tomorrow. I'm going to act as if I were free
      already. The rain fills me full of the country. Will you both come with me
      tomorrow or next day, and see the Pellesley place in Hertfordshire? By the
      photographs it's the best thing in the market. The newest parts of it are
      Tudor&mdash;and that's what I've always wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unexpected you are!&rdquo; commented Miss Madden. &ldquo;You are almost the last
      person I should have looked to for a sentiment about Tudor foundations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe put out his lips a trifle. &ldquo;Ah, you don't know me,&rdquo; he replied, in
      a voice milder than his look had promised. &ldquo;Because I'm rough and
      practical, you mustn't think I don't know good things when I see them.
      Why, all the world is going to have living proof very soon&rdquo;&mdash;he
      paused, and sent a smile surcharged with meaning toward the silent member
      of the trio&mdash;&ldquo;living proof that I'm the greatest judge of perfection
      in beauty of my time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his glass as he spoke, and the ladies accepted with an
      inclination of the head, and a touch of the wine at their lips, his tacit
      toast. &ldquo;Oh, I think I do know you,&rdquo; said Celia Madden, calmly discursive.
      &ldquo;Up to a certain point, you are not so unlike other men. If people appeal
      to your imagination, and do not contradict you, or bore you, or get in
      your way, you are capable of being very nice indeed to them. But that
      isn't a very uncommon quality. What is uncommon in you&mdash;at least that
      is my reading&mdash;is something which according to circumstances may be
      nice, or very much the other way about. It's something which stands quite
      apart from standards of morals or ethics or the ordinary emotions. But I
      don't know, whether it is desirable for me to enter into this extremely
      personal analysis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, go on,&rdquo; Thorpe urged her. He watched her face with an almost
      excited interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I should say that you possessed a capacity for sudden and
      capricious action in large matters, equally impatient of reasoning and
      indifferent to consequences, which might be very awkward, and even tragic,
      to people who happened to annoy you, or stand in your road. You have the
      kind of organization in which, within a second, without any warning or
      reason, a passing whim may have worked itself up into an imperative law&mdash;something
      you must obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man smiled and nodded approvingly: &ldquo;You've got me down fine,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I talk with a good deal of confidence,&rdquo; she went on, with a cheerless,
      ruminative little laugh, &ldquo;because it is my own organization that I am
      describing, too. The difference is that I was allowed to exploit my
      capacity for mischief very early. I had my own way in my teens&mdash;my
      own money, my own power&mdash;of course only of a certain sort, and in a
      very small place. But I know what I did with that power. I spread trouble
      and misery about me&mdash;always of course on a small scale. Then a group
      of things happened in a kind of climax&mdash;a very painful climax&mdash;and
      it shook the nonsense out of me. My brother and my father died&mdash;some
      other sobering things happened...and luckily I was still young enough to
      stop short, and take stock of myself, and say that there were certain
      paths I would never set foot on again&mdash;and stick to it. But with you&mdash;do
      you see?&mdash;power only comes to you when you are a mature man.
      Experiences, no matter how unpleasant they are, will not change you now.
      You will not be moved by this occurrence or that to distrust yourself, or
      reconsider your methods, or form new resolutions. Oh no! Power will be
      terrible in your hands, if people whom you can injure provoke you to cruel
      courses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear&mdash;dear!&rdquo; broke in Lady Cressage. &ldquo;What a distressing Mrs.
      Gummidge-Cassandra you are, Celia! Pray stop it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;she's right enough,&rdquo; said Thorpe, gravely. &ldquo;That's the kind of
      man I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed so profoundly interested in the contemplation of this portrait
      which had been drawn of him, that the others respected his reflective
      silence. He sat for some moments, idly fingering a fork on the table, and
      staring at a blotch of vivid red projected through a decanter upon the
      cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that's the only kind of man it's worth while to be,&rdquo; he
      added at last, still speaking with thoughtful deliberation. &ldquo;There's
      nothing else in the world so big as power&mdash;strength. If you have
      that, you can get everything else. But if you have it, and don't use it,
      then it rusts and decays on your hands. It's like a thoroughbred horse.
      You can't keep it idle in the stable. If you don't exercise it, you lose
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He appeared to be commenting upon some illustration which had occurred to
      his own mind, but was not visible to his auditors. While they regarded
      him, he was prompted to admit them to his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a case of it today,&rdquo; he said, and then paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; put in Miss Madden. &ldquo;The fact that some Frenchwoman, of whom
      you had never heard before, was going to lose her marriage portion caught
      your attention, and on the instant you presented her with $10,000, an
      exercise of power which happens to be on the generous side&mdash;but still
      entirely unreasoning, and not deserving of any intellectual respect. And
      here's the point: if it had happened that somebody else chanced to produce
      an opposite impression upon you, you would have been capable of taking
      $50,000 away from him with just as light a heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe's face beamed with repressed amusement. &ldquo;As a matter of fact it was
      that kind of case I was going to mention. I wasn't referring to the girl
      and her marriage portion. A young man came to me today&mdash;came into my
      room all cock-a-whoop, smiling to himself with the notion that he had only
      to name what he wanted, and I would give it to him&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped abruptly, with a confused little laugh. He had been upon the
      brink of telling about Lord Plowden's discomfiture, and even now the story
      itched upon his tongue. It cost him an effort to put the narrative aside,
      the while he pondered the arguments which had suddenly reared themselves
      against publicity. When at last he spoke, it was with a glance of
      conscious magnanimity toward the lady who had consented to be his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he said, lightly. &ldquo;There wasn't much to it. The man annoyed
      me, somehow&mdash;and he didn't get what he came for&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he was entitled to get it?&rdquo; asked Celia Madden. Thorpe's lips pouted
      over a reply. &ldquo;Well&mdash;no,&rdquo; he said, with a kind of reluctance. &ldquo;He got
      strictly what he was entitled to&mdash;precisely what I had promised him&mdash;and
      he wrung up his nose at that&mdash;and then I actually gave him 15,000
      pounds he wasn't entitled to at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly see what it proves, then,&rdquo; Edith Cressage remarked, and the
      subject was dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some two hours later, Thorpe took his departure. It was not until he was
      getting into the hansom which had been summoned, that it all at once
      occurred to him that he had not for a moment been alone with his
      betrothed. Upon reflection, as the cab sped smoothly forward, this seemed
      odd to him. He decided finally that there was probably some social rule
      about such things which he didn't understand.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In the drawing-room of the house in Grafton Street which he had quitted,
      the two ladies sat with faces averted from each other, in constrained
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith Cressage rose at last, and took a few aimless steps, with her hands
      at her hair. &ldquo;Well&mdash;I'm embarked&mdash;fairly under way!&rdquo; she said,
      in clear-cut, almost provocative tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't at all know what to say,&rdquo; her companion replied, slowly. &ldquo;I fancy
      that you exaggerate my disapproval. Perhaps it ought not even to be called
      disapproval at all. It is only that I am puzzled&mdash;and a little
      frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am frightened too,&rdquo; said the other, but with eagerness rather than
      trepidation in her voice. &ldquo;That is why I did not give you the signal to
      leave us alone. I couldn't quite get up the nerve for it. But would you
      believe it?&mdash;that is one of the charms of the thing. There is an
      excitement about it that exhilarates me. To get happiness through terror&mdash;you
      can't understand that, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm trying. I think I'm beginning to understand,&rdquo; said Miss Madden,
      vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever set yourself to comprehending why Marie Stuart married
      Bothwell?&rdquo; asked Edith, looking down upon the other with illuminating
      fixity. &ldquo;You have it all&mdash;all there. Marie got tired of the smooth
      people, the usual people. There was the promise of adventure, and risk,
      and peril, and the grand emotions with the big, dark brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't a happy story&mdash;this parallel that you pick out,&rdquo; commented
      Celia, absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy! Pah!&rdquo; retorted Edith, with spirit. &ldquo;Who knows if it wasn't the
      only really happy thing in her life? The snobs and prigs all scold her and
      preach sermons at her&mdash;they did it in her lifetime: they do it now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Oh come, I'm neither a snob nor a prig,&rdquo; put in Celia, looking up in her
      turn, and tempering with a smile the energy of her tone&mdash;&ldquo;I don't
      blame her for her Bothwell; I don't criticize her. I never was even able
      to mind about her killing Darnley. You see I take an extremely liberal
      view. One might almost call it broad. But if I had been one of her ladies&mdash;her
      bosom friends&mdash;say Catherine Seton&mdash;and she had talked with me
      about it&mdash;I think I should have confessed to some forebodings&mdash;some
      little misgivings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know what she would have said?&rdquo; Edith's swift question, put
      with a glowing face and a confident voice, had in it the ring of assured
      triumph. &ldquo;She would have answered you: 'My dearest girl, all my life I
      have done what other people told me to do. In my childhood I was given in
      marriage to a criminal idiot. In my premature widowhood I was governed by
      a committee of scoundrels of both sexes until another criminal idiot was
      imposed upon me as a second husband. My own personality has never had the
      gleam of a chance. I have never yet done any single thing because I wanted
      to do it. Between first my politician-mother and her band of tonsured
      swindlers, and then my cantankerous brother and his crew of snarling and
      sour-minded preachers, and all the court liars and parasites and spies
      that both sides surrounded me with, I have lived an existence that isn't
      life at all. I purport to be a woman, but I have never been suffered to
      see a genuine man. And now here is one&mdash;or what I think to be one&mdash;and
      I'm given to understand that he is a pirate and a murderer and an
      unspeakable ruffian generally&mdash;but he takes my fancy, and he has
      beckoned to me to come to him, and so you will kindly get me my hat and
      jacket and gloves.' That's what she would have said to you, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rdquo;&mdash;said Celia, rising after a moment's pause, and putting her
      hand upon Edith's arm&mdash;&ldquo;I would have answered, 'Dearest lady, in
      whatever befalls, I pray you never to forget that I am to the end your
      fond and devoted and loyal servant.'&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      AUGUST wore itself out in parched tedium, and a September began which
      seemed even more unbearable in town,&mdash;and still Thorpe did not get
      away from London.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as the payment of an exorbitant rent in advance, and the receipt of
      innumerable letters from a restless and fussy steward whom he had not yet
      seen, went as evidence, he knew himself to be the tenant in possession of
      a great shooting in Morayshire. He had several photographs of what was
      called the lodge, but looked like something between a mansion and a
      baronial castle, on the mantel of the Board Room. The reflection that this
      sumptuous residence had been his for a month, and that it daily stood
      waiting for him, furnished and swept and provisioned for his coming, did
      nothing to help the passing of time in the hot, fagged City. More than
      once he had said resolutely that, on the morrow, or at the worst the next
      day, he would go&mdash;but in the event he had not gone. In the last week
      of August he had proceeded to the length of sending his niece and nephew
      Northward, and shutting up the house in Ovington Square, and betaking
      himself to the Savoy Hotel. This had appeared at the time to be almost
      equivalent to his getting away himself,&mdash;to be at least a first stage
      in the progress of his own journey. But at the hotel he had stuck fast,&mdash;and
      now, on the tenth of September, was no nearer the moors and the
      deer-forest than he had been a month before.
    </p>
    <p>
      A novel sense of loneliness,&mdash;of the fatuity of present existence,&mdash;weighed
      grievously upon him. The ladies of Grafton Street had left town upon a
      comprehensive itinerary of visits which included the Malvern country, and
      a ducal castle in Shropshire, and a place in Westmoreland. There was
      nothing very definite about the date of their coming to him in Scotland.
      The lady who had consented to marry him had, somehow, omitted to promise
      that she would write to him. An arrangement existed, instead, by which she
      and his niece Julia were to correspond, and to fix between themselves the
      details of the visit to Morayshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe hardly went to the point of annoyance with this arrangement. He was
      conscious of no deep impulse to write love-letters himself, and there was
      nothing in the situation which made his failure to receive love-letters
      seem unnatural. The absence of moonshine, at least during this preliminary
      season, had been quite taken for granted between them, and he did not
      complain even to himself. There was even a kind of proud satisfaction for
      him in the thought that, though he had all but completed the purchase of
      the noble Pellesley estate for Edith Cressage, he had never yet kissed
      her. The reserve he imposed upon himself gave him a certain aristocratic
      fineness in his own eyes. It was the means by which he could feel himself
      to be most nearly her equal. But he remained very lonely in London, none
      the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that a great deal of society was continually offered to him,
      and even thrust upon him. In the popular phrase, London was empty, but
      there seemed to be more people than ever who desired Mr. Stormont Thorpe'
      s presence at their dinner-tables, or their little theatre or card or
      river parties. He clung sullenly to his rule of going nowhere, but it was
      not so simple a matter to evade the civilities and importunities of those
      who were stopping at the hotel, or who came there to waylay him at the
      entrance, or to encounter him in the restaurant. He could not always
      refuse to sit down at tables when attractively-dressed and vivacious women
      made room for him, or to linger over cigars and wine with their husbands
      and escorts later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      An incessant and spirited court was paid to him by many different groups
      of interested people who were rarely at the pains to dissemble their aims.
      He formed a manner for the reception of these advances, compounded of
      joviality, cynicism, and frank brutality, which nobody, to his face at
      least, resented. If women winced under his mocking rudenesses of speech
      and smile, if men longed to kill him for the cold insolence of his refusal
      to let them inside his guard, they sedulously kept it from him. The
      consciousness that everybody was afraid of him,&mdash;that everybody would
      kneel to him, and meekly take insult and ignominy from him, if only hope
      remained to them of getting something out of him,&mdash;hardened like a
      crust upon his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to get a sense of companionship from people who cringed
      to him, and swallowed his affronts and cackled at his jokes with equal
      docility. Sometimes he had a passing amusement in the rough pleasantries
      and cruelties which they drew from him. There were two or three bright
      Jewish women, more gayly clever and impudent, perhaps, than beautiful,
      with whom he found it genuine fun to talk, and concerning whom he was
      perpetually conceiving projects which could not have been discussed with
      their husbands, and as perpetually doing nothing to test their
      feasibility. But these diversions were in their essence unsubstantial.
      There was not even the semblance of a real friendship among them,&mdash;and
      loneliness became an increasing burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister at the old book-shop exasperated him nowadays to a degree which
      often provoked within him the resolution to have done with her. He had a
      score of projects for her betterment, each capable of as many variations
      and eager adaptations to suit her fancy, but to them all and sundry she
      opposed a barrier of stupidly passive negation. There was nothing she
      wanted done for her. She would not exchange the work she had been brought
      up in for a life of idleness. She did not want, and would not know what to
      do with, a bigger shop than she had. An augmentation of her capital would
      be of no use, because there was no room in the crowded little shop for a
      larger stock than it contained. She was entirely satisfied with the dingy
      home overhead, and declined to think even of moving elsewhere. Over and
      over again she met his propositions with a saying which he could recall
      having particularly hated on their father's lips,&mdash;&ldquo;It's ill teaching
      an old dog new tricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have them taught you with a stick,&rdquo; he had told her roundly,
      on the last occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had merely shrugged her gaunt shoulders at him. &ldquo;You think you can
      bully everybody and make them crawl to you,&mdash;but there's no good your
      trying it on with me,&rdquo; she had told him, and he had pushed his way out of
      the shop almost stamping his feet. It was clear to him at that moment that
      he would never darken her door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet now, on this afternoon of the tenth, as he lounged with a cigar and a
      City paper in his apartment at the hotel after luncheon, wondering whether
      it were too hot to issue forth for a walk to the Park, the irrelevant idea
      of going round to see his sister kept coming into his mind. He seated
      himself and fastened his attention upon the paper,&mdash;but off it
      slipped again to the old book-shop, and to that curious, cross-grained
      figure, its mistress. He abandoned himself to thinking about her&mdash;and
      discovered that a certain unique quality in her challenged his admiration.
      She was the only absolutely disinterested person he knew&mdash;the only
      creature in the world, apparently, who did not desire to make something
      out of him. She was not at all well-off,&mdash;was indeed rather poor than
      otherwise,&mdash;and here was her only brother a millionaire, and in her
      dumb way she had a sisterly affection for him, and yet she could not be
      argued or cajoled into touching a penny of his money. Surely there could
      be no other woman like her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe realized that it was a distinction to have such a sister,&mdash;and
      behind this thought rose obscurely the suggestion that there must be
      wonderful blood in a race which had produced such a daughter. And for that
      matter, such a son too! He lifted his head, and looked abstractedly before
      him, as if he were gazing at some apotheosis of himself in a mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      He beheld all at once something concrete and personal, obtruded into the
      heart of his reverie, the sight of which dimly astounded him. For the
      moment, with opened lips he stared at it,&mdash;then slowly brought
      himself to comprehend what had happened. An old man had by some oversight
      of the hotel servants been allowed to enter the room unannounced. He had
      wandered in noiselessly, and had moved in a purblind fashion to the centre
      of the apartment. The vagueness of the expression on his face and of his
      movements hinted at a vacant mind or too much drink,&mdash;but Thorpe gave
      no thought to either hypothesis. The face itself&mdash;no&mdash;yes&mdash;it
      was the face of old Tavender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of God! What are you doing here?&rdquo; Thorpe gasped at this
      extraordinary apparition. Still staring, he began to push back his chair
      and put his weight upon his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;Thorpe&rdquo;&mdash;the other began, thrusting forward his head to
      look through his spectacles&mdash;&ldquo;so it is you, after all. I didn't know
      whether I was going to find you or not. This place has got so many turns
      and twists to it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But good heavens!&rdquo; interposed the bewildered Thorpe. He had risen to his
      feet. He mechanically took the hand which the other had extended to him.
      &ldquo;What in hell&rdquo;&mdash;he began, and broke off again. The aroma of alcohol
      on the air caught his sense, and his mind stopped at the perception that
      Tavender was more or less drunk. He strove to spur it forward, to compel
      it to encompass the meanings of this new crisis, but almost in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought I'd look you up,&rdquo; said the old man, buoyantly. &ldquo;Nobody in London
      I'd rather see than you. How are you, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you come over for? When did you get here?&rdquo; Thorpe put the
      questions automatically. His self-control was returning to him; his
      capable brain pushed forward now under something like disciplined
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I guess I owe it all to you,&rdquo; replied Tavender. Traces of the old
      Quaker effect which had been so characteristic of him still hung about his
      garb and mien, but there shone a new assurance on his benignant, rubicund
      face. Prosperity had visibly liberalized and enheartened him. He shook
      Thorpe's hand again. &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;it must have been all through you!&rdquo;
       he repeated. &ldquo;I got my cable three weeks ago&mdash;'Hasten to London,
      urgent business, expenses and liberal fee guaranteed, Rubber Consols'&mdash;that's
      what the cable said, that is, the first one and of course you're the man
      that introduced me to those rubber people. And so don't you see I owe it
      all to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His insistence upon his obligation was suddenly almost tearful. Thorpe
      thought hard as he replied: &ldquo;Oh&mdash;that's all right. I'm very glad
      indeed to have helped you along. And so you came over for the Rubber
      Consols people, eh? Well&mdash;that's good. Seen 'em yet? You haven't told
      me when you landed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Came up from Southampton this morning. My brother-in-law was down there
      to meet me. We came up to London together.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your brother-in-law,&rdquo;
       observed Thorpe, meditatively. Some shadowy, remote impression of having
      forgotten something troubled his mind for an instant. &ldquo;Is your
      brother-in-law in the rubber business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extraor'nary thing,&rdquo; explained Tavender, beamingly, &ldquo;he don't know no
      more about the whole affair than the man 'n the moon. I asked him today&mdash;but
      he couldn't tell me anything about the business&mdash;what it was I'd been
      sent for, or anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&mdash;he knew you'd been sent for,&rdquo; Thorpe commented upon brief
      reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he sent the second cable himself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What second cable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why it was the next day,&mdash;or maybe it was sent that same night, and
      not delivered till morning,&mdash;I got another cable, this time from my
      brother-in-law, telling me to cable him what ship I sailed on and when. So
      of course he knew all about it&mdash;but now he says he don't. He's a
      curious sort of fellow, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how is he mixed up in it?&rdquo; demanded Thorpe, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as nearly as I can figure it out, he works for one of the men
      that's at the head of this rubber company. It appears that he happened to
      show this man&mdash;he's a man of title, by the way&mdash;a letter I wrote
      to him last spring, when I got back to Mexico&mdash;and so in that way
      this man, when he wanted me to come over, just told Gafferson to cable to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gafferson,&rdquo; Thorpe repeated, very slowly, and with almost an effect of
      listlessness. He was conscious of no surprise; it was as if he had divined
      all along the sinister shadows of Lord Plowden and Lord Plowden's
      gardener, lurking in the obscurity behind this egregious old ass of a
      Tavender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a tremendous horticultural sharp,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Probably you've
      heard tell of him. He's taken medals for new flowers and things till you
      can't rest. He's over at&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;the Royal
      Aquarium, now, to see the Dahlia Show. I went over there with him, but it
      didn't seem to be my kind of a show, and so I left him there, and I'm to
      look in again for him at 5:30. I'm going down to his place in the country
      with him tonight, to meet his boss&mdash;the nobleman I spoke of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nice,&rdquo; Thorpe commented, slowly. &ldquo;I envy anybody who can get into
      the country these days. But how did you know I was here?&rdquo; &ldquo;The woman in
      the book-store told me&mdash;I went there the first thing. You might be
      sure I'd look you up. Nobody was ever a better friend than you've been to
      me, Thorpe. And do you know what I want you to do? I want you to come
      right bang out, now, and have a drink with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of something of the sort myself,&rdquo; the big man replied.
      &ldquo;I'll get my hat, and be with you in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the next room he relinquished his countenance to a frown of fierce
      perplexity. More than a minute passed in this scowling preoccupation. Then
      his face lightened with the relief of an idea, and he stepped confidently
      back into the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; he said, jovially. &ldquo;We'll have a drink downstairs, and then
      we'll drive up to Hanover Square and see if we can't find a friend of mine
      at his club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the office below he stopped long enough to secure a considerable roll
      of bank-notes in exchange for a cheque. A little later, a hansom deposited
      the couple at the door of the Asian Club, and Thorpe, in the outer hallway
      of this institution, clicked his teeth in satisfaction at the news that
      General Kervick was on the premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General, having been found by a boy and brought down, extended to his
      guests a hospitality which was none the less urbane for the evidences of
      surprise with which it was seasoned. He concealed so indifferently his
      inability to account for Tavender, that the anxious Thorpe grew annoyed
      with him, but happily Tavender's perceptions were less subtle. He gazed
      about him in his dim-eyed way with childlike interest, and babbled
      cheerfully over his liquor. He had not been inside a London club before,
      and his glimpse of the reading-room, where, isolated, purple-faced,
      retired old Empire-makers sat snorting in the silence, their gouty feet
      propped up on foot-rests, their white brows scowling over the pages of
      French novels, particularly impressed him. It was a new and halcyon vision
      of the way to spend one's declining years. And the big smoking-room&mdash;where
      the leather cushions were so low and so soft, and the connection between
      the bells and the waiters was so efficient&mdash;that was even better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe presently made an excuse for taking Kervick apart. &ldquo;I brought this
      old jackass here for a purpose,&rdquo; he said in low, gravely mandatory tones.
      &ldquo;He thinks he's got an appointment at 5:30 this afternoon&mdash;but he's
      wrong. He hasn't. He's not going to have any appointment at all&mdash;for
      a long time yet. I want you to get him drunk, there where he sits, and
      then take him away with you, and get him drunker still, and then take a
      train with him somewhere&mdash;any station but Charing Cross or that line&mdash;and
      I don't care where you land with him&mdash;Scotland or Ireland or France&mdash;whatever
      you like. Here's some money for you&mdash;and you can write to me for
      more. I don't care what you say to him&mdash;make up any yarn you like&mdash;only
      keep him pacified, and keep him away from London, and don't let a living
      soul talk to him&mdash;till I give you the word. You'll let me know where
      you are. I'll get away now&mdash;and mind, General, a good deal depends on
      the way you please me in this thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier's richly-florid face and intent, bulging blue eyes expressed
      vivid comprehension. He nodded with eloquence as he slipped the notes into
      his trousers pocket. &ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; he murmured with martial brevity, from
      under his white, tight moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      With only a vague word or two of meaningless explanation to Tavender,
      Thorpe took his departure, and walked back to the hotel. From what he had
      learned and surmised, it was not difficult to put the pieces of the puzzle
      together. This ridiculous old fool, he remembered now, had reproached
      himself, when he was in England before, for his uncivil neglect of his
      brother-in-law. By some absurd chance, this damned brother-in-law happened
      to be Gafferson. It was clear enough that, when he returned to Mexico,
      Tavender had written to Gafferson, explaining the unexpected pressure of
      business which had taken up all his time in England. Probably he had been
      idiot enough to relate what he of course regarded as the most wonderful
      piece of good news&mdash;how the worthless concession he had been deluded
      into buying had been bought back from him. As likely as not he had even
      identified the concession, and given Thorpe's name as that of the man who
      had first impoverished and then mysteriously enriched him. At all events,
      he had clearly mentioned that he had a commission to report upon the
      Rubber Consols property, and had said enough else to create the impression
      that there were criminal secrets connected with its sale to the London
      Company. The rest was easy. Gafferson, knowing Lord Plowden's relation to
      the Company, had shown him Tavender's letter. Lord Plowden, meditating
      upon it, had seen a way to be nasty&mdash;and had vindictively plunged
      into it. He had brought Tavender from Mexico to London, to use him as a
      weapon. All this was as obvious as the nose on one's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a weapon for what? Thorpe, as this question put itself in his mind,
      halted before a shop-window full of soft-hued silk fabrics, to muse upon
      an answer. The delicate tints and surfaces of what was before his eyes
      seemed somehow to connect themselves with the subject. Plowden himself was
      delicately-tinted and refined of texture. Vindictiveness was too plain and
      coarse an emotion to sway such a complicated and polished organism. He
      reasoned it out, as he stood with lack-lustre gaze before the plate-glass
      front, aloof among a throng of eager and talkative women who pressed
      around him&mdash;that Plowden would not have spent his money on a mere
      impulse of mischief-making. He would be counting upon something more
      tangible than revenge&mdash;something that could be counted and weighed
      and converted into a bank-balance. He smiled when he reached this
      conclusion&mdash;greatly surprising and confusing a matronly lady into
      whose correct face he chanced to be looking at the instant&mdash;and
      turning slowly, continued his walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the office of the hotel, he much regretted not having driven instead,
      for he learned that Semple had twice telephoned from the City for him. It
      was late in the afternoon&mdash;he noted with satisfaction that the clock
      showed it to be already past the hour of the Tavender-Gafferson
      appointment,&mdash;but he had Semple's office called up, upon the chance
      that someone might be there. The clerk had not consumed more than ten
      minutes in the preliminaries of finding out that no one was there&mdash;Thorpe
      meanwhile passing savage comments to the other clerks about the British
      official conception of the telephone as an instrument of discipline and
      humiliation&mdash;when Semple himself appeared in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Broker gave an exclamation of relief at seeing Thorpe, and then,
      apparently indifferent to the display of excitement he was exhibiting,
      drew him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come somewhere where we can talk,&rdquo; he whispered nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had never seen the little Scotchman in such a flurry. &ldquo;We'll go up
      to my rooms,&rdquo; he said, and led the way to the lift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs, Semple bolted the door of the sitting-room behind them, and
      satisfied himself that there was no one in the adjoining bedroom. Then,
      unburdening himself with another sigh, he tossed aside his hat, and looked
      keenly up at the big man. &ldquo;There's the devil to pay,&rdquo; he said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had a fleeting pride in the lethargic, composed front he was able
      to present. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said with forced placidity. &ldquo;If he's got to be
      paid, we'll pay him.&rdquo; He continued to smile a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nah joke,&rdquo; the other hastened to warn him. &ldquo;I have it from two
      different quarters. An application has been made to the Stock Exchange
      Committee, this afternoon, to intervene and stop our business, on the
      ground of fraud. It comes verra straight to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe regarded his Broker contemplatively. The news fitted with precision
      into what he had previously known; it was rendered altogether harmless by
      the precautions he had already taken. &ldquo;Well, keep your hair on,&rdquo; he said,
      quietly. &ldquo;If there were fifty applications, they wouldn't matter the worth
      of that soda-water cork. Won't you have a drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Semple, upon reflection, said he would. The unmoved equipoise of the big
      man visibly reassured him. He sipped at his bubbling tumbler and smacked
      his thin lips. &ldquo;Man, I've had an awful fright,&rdquo; he said at last, in the
      tone of one whose ease of mind is returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave you credit for more nerve,&rdquo; observed the other, eyeing him in not
      unkindly fashion over his glass. &ldquo;You've been so plumb full of sand all
      the while&mdash;I didn't think you'd weaken now. Why, we're within two
      days of home, now&mdash;and for you to get rattled at this late hour&mdash;you
      ought to be ashamed of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Scotchman looked into the bottom of his glass, as he turned it
      thoughtfully round. &ldquo;I'm relieved to see the way you take it,&rdquo; he said,
      after a pause. With increased hesitation he went dryly on: &ldquo;I've never
      enquired minutely into the circumstances of the flotation. It has not
      seemed to be my business to do so, and upon advice I may say that the
      Committee would not hold that such was my business. My position is quite
      clear, upon that point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, perfectly,&rdquo; Thorpe assented. &ldquo;It couldn't possibly be any of your
      business&mdash;either then, or now.&rdquo; He gave a significant touch of
      emphasis to these last two words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Semple, with a glance of swift comprehension. &ldquo;You must
      not think I am asking any intrusive questions. If you tell me that&mdash;that
      there is no ground for uneasiness&mdash;I am verra pleased indeed to
      accept the assurance. That is ample information for my purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take it from me,&rdquo; Thorpe told him. He picked up a red book from a
      side table, and turned over its pages with his thick thumb. &ldquo;This is what
      Rule 59 says,&rdquo; he went on: &ldquo;'NO APPLICATION WHICH HAS FOR ITS OBJECT TO
      ANNUL ANY BARGAIN IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE SHALL BE ENTERTAINED BY THE
      COMMITTEE, UNLESS UPON A SPECIFIC ALLEGATION OF FRAUD OR WILFUL
      MISREPRESENTATION.' Shall be entertained, d'ye see? They can't even
      consider anything of the sort, because it says 'specific,' and I tell you
      plainly that anything 'specific' is entirely out of the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Broker lifted his sandy brows in momentary apprehension. &ldquo;If it turns
      upon the precise definition of a word,&rdquo; he remarked, doubtingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&mdash;but it doesn't,&rdquo; Thorpe reassured him. &ldquo;See here&mdash;I'll
      tell you something. You're not asking any questions. That's as it should
      be. And I'm not forcing information upon you which you don't need in your
      business. That's as it should be, too. But in between these two, there's a
      certain margin of facts that there's no harm in your knowing. A scheme to
      blackmail me is on foot. It's rather a fool-scheme, if you ask me, but it
      might have been a nuisance if it had been sprung on us unawares. It
      happened, however, that I twigged this scheme about two hours ago. It was
      the damnedest bit of luck you ever heard of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't have luck,&rdquo; put in Semple, appreciatively. &ldquo;Other men have
      luck. You have something else&mdash;I don't give it a name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe smiled upon him, and went on. &ldquo;I twigged it, anyway. I went out,
      and I drove the biggest kind of spike through that fool-scheme&mdash;plumb
      through its heart. Tomorrow a certain man will come to me&mdash;oh, I
      could almost tell you the kind of neck-tie he'll wear&mdash;and he'll put
      up his bluff to me, and I'll hear him out&mdash;and then&mdash;then I'll
      let the floor drop out from under him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; said Semple, with relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay and dine with me tonight,&rdquo; Thorpe impulsively suggested, &ldquo;and we'll
      go to some Music Hall afterward. There's a knock-about pantomime outfit at
      the Canterbury&mdash;Martinetti I think the name is&mdash;that's damned
      good. You get plenty of laugh, and no tiresome blab to listen to. The
      older I get, the more I think of people that keep their mouths shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; observed Semple again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN the Board Room, next day, Thorpe awaited the coming of Lord Plowden
      with the serene confidence of a prophet who not only knows that he is
      inspired, but has had an illicit glimpse into the workings of the
      machinery of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat motionless at his desk, like a big spider for who time has no
      meaning. Before him lay two newspapers, folded so as to expose paragraphs
      heavily indicated by blue pencil-marks. They were not financial journals,
      and for that reason it was improbable that he would have seen these
      paragraphs, if the Secretary of the Company had not marked them, and
      brought them to him. That official had been vastly more fluttered by them
      than he found it possible to be. In slightly-varying language, these two
      items embedded in so-called money articles reported the rumour that a
      charge of fraud had arisen in connection with the Rubber Consols corner,
      and that sensational disclosures were believed to be impending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe looked with a dulled, abstracted eye at these papers, lying on the
      desk, and especially at the blue pencil-lines upon them, as he pondered
      many things. Their statement, thus scattered broadcast to the public,
      seemed at once to introduce a new element into the situation, and to leave
      it unchanged. That influence of some sort had been exerted to get this
      story into these papers, it did not occur to him for an instant to doubt.
      To his view, all things that were put into papers were put there for a
      purpose&mdash;it would express his notion more clearly, perhaps, to say
      for a price. Of the methods of Fleet Street, he was profoundly ignorant,
      but his impressions of them were all cynical. Upon reflection, however, it
      seemed unlikely to him that Lord Plowden had secured the insertion of
      these rumours. So far as Thorpe could fathom that nobleman's game, its
      aims would not be served by premature publicity of this kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, the outlines of a more probable combination took shape in his
      thoughts. There were left in the grip of the &ldquo;corner&rdquo; now only two
      victims,&mdash;Rostocker and Aronson. They owed this invidious
      differentiation to a number of causes: they had been the chief sellers of
      stock, being between them responsible for the delivery of 8,500 Rubber
      Consols shares, which they could not get; they were men of larger fortune
      than the other &ldquo;shorts,&rdquo; and therefore could with safety be squeezed
      longest; what was fortunate for him under the circumstances, they were the
      two men against whom Thorpe's personal grudge seemed able to maintain
      itself most easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these reasons, they had already been mulcted in differences to the
      extent of, in round numbers, 165,000 pounds. On the morrow, the twelfth of
      September, it was Thorpe's plan to allow them to buy in the shares they
      needed, at 22 or 23 pounds per share&mdash;which would take from them
      nearly 200,000 pounds more. He had satisfied himself that they could, and
      would if necessary, pay this enormous ransom for their final escape from
      the &ldquo;corner.&rdquo; Partly because it was not so certain that they could pay
      more, partly because he was satiated with spoils and tired of the strain
      of the business, he had decided to permit this escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized now, however, that they on their side had planned to escape
      without paying any final ransom at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was clearly the meaning of these paragraphs, and of the
      representations which had yesterday been made to the Stock Exchange
      Committee. He had additional knowledge today of the character of these
      representations. Nothing definite had been alleged, but some of the
      members of the Committee had been informally notified, so Semple had this
      morning learned, that a specific charge of fraud, supported by
      unanswerable proof, was to be brought against the Rubber Consols
      management on the morrow. Thorpe reasoned out now, step by step, what that
      meant. Lord Plowden had sought out Rostocker and Aronson, and had told
      them that he had it in his power ignominiously to break the &ldquo;corner.&rdquo; He
      could hardly have told them the exact nature of his power, because until
      he should have seen Tavender he did not himself know what it was. But he
      had given them to understand that he could prove fraud, and they, scenting
      in this the chance of saving 200,000 pounds, and seeing that time was so
      terribly short, had hastened to the Committeemen with this vague
      declaration that, on the morrow, they could prove&mdash;they did not
      precisely know what. Yes&mdash;plainly enough&mdash;that was what had
      happened. And it would be these two Jew &ldquo;wreckers,&rdquo; eager to invest their
      speculative notification to the Committee with as much of an air of
      formality as possible, who had caused the allusions to it to be published
      in these papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe's lustreless eye suddenly twinkled with mirth as he reached this
      conclusion; his heavy face brightened into a grin of delight. A vision of
      Lord Plowden's absurd predicament rose vividly before him, and he chuckled
      aloud at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed only the most natural thing in the world that, at this instant,
      a clerk should open the door and nod with meaning to the master. The
      visitor whom he had warned the people in the outer office he expected, had
      arrived. Thorpe was still laughing to himself when Lord Plowden entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! How d'ye do!&rdquo; he called out to him from where he sat at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hilarity of the manner into which he had been betrayed, upon the
      instant surprised and rather confused him. He had not been altogether
      clear as to how he should receive Plowden, but certainly a warm joviality
      had not occurred to him as appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nobleman was even more taken aback. He stared momentarily at the big
      man's beaming mask, and then, with nervous awkwardness, executed a series
      of changes in his own facial expression and demeanour. He flushed red,
      opened his lips to say &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and then twisted them into a doubting and
      seemingly painful smile. He looked with very bright-eyed intentness at
      Thorpe, as he advanced, and somewhat spasmodically put out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Thorpe not to see this hand. &ldquo;How are you!&rdquo; he repeated in
      a more mechanical voice, and withdrew his smile. Lord Plowden fidgeted on
      his feet for a brief, embarrassed interval before the desk, and then
      dropped into a chair at its side. With a deliberate effort at nonchalance,
      he crossed his legs, and caressed the ankle on his knee with a careless
      hand. &ldquo;Anything new?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe lolled back in his arm-chair. &ldquo;I'm going to be able to get away in
      a few days' time,&rdquo; he said, indifferently. &ldquo;I expect to finally wind up
      the business on the Stock Exchange tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;yes,&rdquo; commented Plowden, vacantly. He seemed to be searching
      after thoughts which had wandered astray. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;of course,&rdquo; Thorpe said after him, with a latent touch of
      significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other looked up quickly, then glanced away again. &ldquo;It's all going as
      you expected, is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than I expected,&rdquo; Thorpe told him, energetically. &ldquo;Much better
      than anybody expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; said Plowden. After a moment's reflection he went on hesitatingly:
      &ldquo;I didn't know. I saw something in one of the papers this morning,&mdash;one
      of the money articles,&mdash;which spoke as if there were some doubt about
      the result. That's why I called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;it's damned good of you to come round, and show such a
      friendly interest.&rdquo; Thorpe's voice seemed candid enough, but there was an
      enigmatic something in his glance which aroused the other's distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you don't take very much stock in the 'friendly interest,'&rdquo; he
      said, with a constrained little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not taking stock in anything new just now,&rdquo; replied Thorpe, lending
      himself lazily to the other's metaphor. &ldquo;I'm loaded up to the gunnels
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A minute of rather oppressive silence ensued. Then Plowden ventured upon
      an opening. &ldquo;All the same, it WAS with an idea of,&mdash;perhaps being of
      use to you,&mdash;that I came here,&rdquo; he affirmed. &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; Thorpe
      put the query almost listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden turned his hands and let his dark eyes sparkle in a gesture
      of amiable uncertainty. &ldquo;That depended upon what was needed. I got the
      impression that you were in trouble&mdash;the paper spoke as if there were
      no doubt of it&mdash;and I imagined that quite probably you would be glad
      to talk with me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Thorpe. &ldquo;So I should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This comprehensive assurance seemed not, however, to facilitate
      conversation. The nobleman looked at the pattern of the sock on the ankle
      he was nursing, and knitted his brows in perplexity. &ldquo;What if the
      Committee of the Stock Exchange decide to interfere?&rdquo; he asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would knock me sky-high,&rdquo; Thorpe admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Approximately, how much may one take 'sky-high' to mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe appeared to calculate. &ldquo;Almost anything up to a quarter of a
      million,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; said Lord Plowden again. &ldquo;Well&mdash;I understand&mdash;I'm given
      to understand&mdash;that very likely that is what the Committee will
      decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it say that in the papers?&rdquo; asked Thorpe. He essayed an effect of
      concern. &ldquo;Where did you see that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't see it,&rdquo; the other explained. &ldquo;It&mdash;it came to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; said Thorpe. &ldquo;That'll be awful! But are you really in earnest? Is
      that what you hear? And does it come at all straight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden nodded portentously. &ldquo;Absolutely straight,&rdquo; he said, with
      gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe, after a momentary stare of what looked like bewilderment, was seen
      to clutch at a straw. &ldquo;But what was it you were saying?&rdquo; he demanded, with
      eagerness. &ldquo;You talked about help&mdash;a minute ago. Did you mean it?
      Have you got a plan? Is there something that you can do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plowden weighed his words. &ldquo;It would be necessary to have a very complete
      understanding,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you like,&rdquo; exclaimed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me&mdash;it would have to be a good deal more definite than that,&rdquo;
       Plowden declared. &ldquo;A 'burnt child'&mdash;you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big man tapped musingly with his finger-nails on the desk. &ldquo;We won't
      quarrel about that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But what I'd like to know first,&mdash;you
      needn't give anything away that you don't want to,&mdash;but what's your
      plan? You say that they've got me in a hole, and that you can get me out.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;In effect&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do you know that I can't get myself out? What do you know about
      the whole thing anyway? Supposing I tell you that I laugh at it&mdash;that
      there's no more ground for raising the suspicion of fraud than there is
      for&mdash;for suspecting that you've got wings and can fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't think you'll tell me that,&rdquo; said Plowden, placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, supposing I don't tell you that,&rdquo; the other resumed,
      argumentatively. &ldquo;Supposing I say instead that it can't be proved. If the
      Committee doesn't have proof NOW,&mdash;within twenty-one or twenty-two
      hours,&mdash;they can't do anything at all. Tomorrow is settling day. All
      along, I've said I would wind up the thing tomorrow. The market-price has
      been made for me by the jobbers yesterday and today. I'm all ready to end
      the whole business tomorrow&mdash;close it all out. And after that's done,
      what do I care about the Stock Exchange Committee? They can investigate
      and be damned! What could they do to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think a man can always be arrested and indicted, and sent to penal
      servitude,&rdquo; said Lord Plowden, with a certain solemnity of tone. &ldquo;There
      are even well-known instances of extradition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe buried his chin deep in his collar, and regarded his companion with
      a fixed gaze, in which the latter detected signs of trepidation. &ldquo;But
      about the Committee&mdash;and tomorrow,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;What do you say
      about that? How can they act in that lightning fashion? And even if proofs
      could be got, how do you suppose they are to be got on the drop of the
      hat, at a minute's notice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The case is of sufficient importance to warrant a special meeting
      tomorrow morning,&rdquo; the other rejoined. &ldquo;One hour's notice, posted in the
      House, is sufficient, I believe. Any three members of the Committee can
      call such a meeting, and I understand that seven make a quorum. You will
      see that a meeting could be held at noon tomorrow, and within half an hour
      could make you a ruined man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;would you call it quite ruined?&rdquo; commented Thorpe. &ldquo;I
      should still have a few sovereigns to go on with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A criminal prosecution would be practically inevitable&mdash;after such a
      disclosure,&rdquo; Plowden reminded him, with augmented severity of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mix the two things up,&rdquo; the other urged. There seemed to the
      listener to be supplication in the voice. &ldquo;It's the action of the
      Committee that you said you could influence. That's what we were talking
      about. You say there will be a special meeting at noon tomorrow&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said there could be one,&rdquo; Plowden corrected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. There CAN be one. And do you say that there can be proof,&mdash;proof
      against me of fraud,&mdash;produced at that meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I say that,&rdquo; the nobleman affirmed, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And further still&mdash;do you say that it rests with you whether that
      proof shall be produced or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden looked into the impassive, deep-eyed gaze which covered him,
      and looked away from it again. &ldquo;I haven't put it in just that form,&rdquo; he
      said, hesitatingly. &ldquo;But in essentials&mdash;yes, that may be taken as
      true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is your figure? How much do you want for holding this proof of
      yours back, and letting me finish scooping the money of your Hebrew
      friends Aronson and Rostocker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peer raised his head, and shot a keenly enquiring glance at the other.
      &ldquo;Are they my friends?&rdquo; he asked, with challenging insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm bound to assume that you have been dealing with them, just as you are
      dealing with me.&rdquo; Thorpe explained his meaning dispassionately, as if the
      transaction were entirely commonplace. &ldquo;You tell them that you're in a
      position to produce proof against me, and ask them what they'll give for
      it. Then naturally enough you come to me, and ask what I'll be willing to
      pay to have the proof suppressed. I quite understand that I must bid
      against these men&mdash;and of course I take it for granted that, since
      you know their figure, you've arranged in your mind what mine is to be. I
      quite understand, too, that I am to pay more than they have offered. That
      is on account of 'friendly interest.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you allude to it,&rdquo; Lord Plowden observed, with a certain calm
      loftiness of tone, &ldquo;there is no harm in saying that you WILL pay something
      on that old score. Once you thrust the promise of something like a hundred
      thousand pounds positively upon me. You insisted on my believing it, and I
      did so, like a fool. I came to you to redeem the promise, and you laughed
      in my face. Very well. It is my turn now. I hold the whip-hand, and I
      should be an ass not to remember things. I shall want that entire one
      hundred thousand pounds from you, and fifty thousand added to it 'on
      account of the 'friendly interest,' as you so intelligently expressed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe's chin burrowed still deeper upon his breast. &ldquo;It's an outrage,&rdquo; he
      said with feeling. Then he added, in tones of dejected resignation: &ldquo;When
      will you want it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the moment when the payments of Rostocker and Aronson are made to you,
      or to your bankers or agents,&rdquo; Lord Plowden replied, with prepared
      facility. He had evidently given much thought to this part of the
      proceedings. &ldquo;And of course I shall expect you to draw up now an agreement
      to that effect. I happen to have a stamped paper with me this time. And if
      you don't mind, we will have it properly witnessed&mdash;this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe looked at him with a disconcertingly leaden stare, the while he
      thought over what had been proposed. &ldquo;That's right enough,&rdquo; he announced
      at last, &ldquo;but I shall expect you to do some writing too. Since we're
      dealing on this basis, there must be no doubt about the guarantee that you
      will perform your part of the contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The performance itself, since payment is conditional upon it&mdash;&rdquo;
       began Plowden, but the other interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I want something better than that. Here&mdash;give me your stamped
      paper.&rdquo; He took the bluish sheet, and, without hesitation, wrote several
      lines rapidly. &ldquo;Here&mdash;this is my promise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to pay you
      150,000 pounds, upon your satisfactory performance of a certain
      undertaking to be separately nominated in a document called 'A,' which we
      will jointly draw up and agree to and sign, and deposit wherever you like&mdash;for
      safe keeping. Now, if you'll sit here, and write out for me a similar
      thing&mdash;that in consideration of my promise of 150,000 pounds, you
      covenant to perform the undertaking to be nominated in the document 'A'&mdash;and
      so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden treated as a matter of course the ready and business-like
      suggestion of the other. Taking his place at the desk in turn, he wrote
      out what had been suggested. Thorpe touched a bell, and the clerk who came
      in perfunctorily attested the signatures upon both papers. Each principal
      folded and pocketed the pledge of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Thorpe, when he had seated himself again at the desk, &ldquo;we are
      all right so far as protection against each other goes. If you don't mind,
      I will draw up a suggestion of what the separate document 'A' should set
      forth. If you don't like it, you can write one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took more time to this task, frowning laboriously over the fresh sheet
      of foolscap, and screening from observation with his hand what he was
      writing. Finally, the task seemed finished to his mind. He took up the
      paper, glanced through it once more, and handed it in silence to the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence also, and with an expression of arrested attention, Lord
      Plowden read these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The undertaking referred to in the two documents of even date, signed
      respectively by Lord Plowden and Stormont Thorpe, is to the effect that at
      some hour between eleven A.M. and three P.M. of September 12th, instant,
      Lord Plowden shall produce before a special meeting of the Committee of
      the Stock Exchange, the person of one Jerome P. Tavender, to explain to
      said Committee his share in the blackmailing scheme of which Lord Plowden,
      over his own signature, has furnished documentary evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nobleman continued to look down at the paper, after the power to hold
      it without shaking had left his hand. There came into his face, mingling
      with and vitiating its rich natural hues of health, a kind of grey shadow.
      It was as if clay was revealing itself beneath faded paint. He did not
      lift his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had been prepared to hail this consummation of his trick with
      boisterous and scornful mirth. Even while the victim was deciphering the
      fatal paper, he had restrained with impatience the desire to burst out
      into bitter laughter. But now there was something in the aspect of
      Plowden's collapse which seemed to forbid triumphant derision. He was
      taking his blow so like a gentleman,&mdash;ashen-pale and quivering, but
      clinging to a high-bred dignity of silence,&mdash;that the impulse to
      exhibit equally good manners possessed Thorpe upon the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;you see how little business you've got, setting yourself to
      buck against a grown-up man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He offered the observation in the tone of the school-teacher, affectedly
      philosophical but secretly jubilant, who harangues a defeated and
      humiliated urchin upon his folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, chuck it!&rdquo; growled Lord Plowden, staring still at the calamitous
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe accepted in good part the intimation that silence was after all
      most decorous. He put his feet up on the corner of the desk, and tipping
      back his chair, surveyed the discomfited Viscount impassively. He forbore
      even to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this swine of a Tavender came straight to you!&rdquo; Lord Plowden had found
      words at last. As he spoke, he lifted his face, and made a show of looking
      the other in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there are a hundred things in your own game, even, that you haven't
      an inkling of,&rdquo; Thorpe told him, lightly. &ldquo;I've been watching every move
      you've made, seeing further ahead in your own game than you did. Why, it
      was too easy! It was like playing draughts with a girl. I knew you would
      come today, for example. I told the people out there that I expected you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes-s,&rdquo; said the other, with rueful bewilderment. &ldquo;You seem to have been
      rather on the spot&mdash;I confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the spot? All over the place!&rdquo; Thorpe lifted himself slightly in his
      chair, and put more animation into his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the mistake you people make!&rdquo; he declared oracularly. &ldquo;You think
      that a man can come into the City without a penny, and form great
      combinations and carry through a great scheme, and wage a fight with the
      smartest set of scoundrels on the London Stock Exchange and beat 'em, and
      make for himself a big fortune&mdash;and still be a fool! You imagine that
      a man like that can be played with, and hoodwinked by amateurs like
      yourself. It's too ridiculous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The perception that apparently Thorpe bore little or no malice had begun
      to spread through Plowden's consciousness. It was almost more surprising
      to him than the revelation of his failure had been. He accustomed himself
      to the thought gradually, and as he did so the courage crept back into his
      glance. He breathed more easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right!&rdquo; he admitted. It cost him nothing to give a maximum of
      fervid conviction to the tone of his words. The big brute's pride in his
      own brains and power was still his weakest point. &ldquo;You are right! I did
      play the fool. And it was all the more stupid, because I was the first man
      in London to recognize the immense forces in you. I said to you at the
      very outset, 'You are going to go far. You are going to be a great man.'
      You remember that, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe nodded. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nobleman, upon reflection, drew a little silver box from his pocket,
      and extracted a match. &ldquo;Do you mind?&rdquo; he asked, and scarcely waiting for a
      token of reply, struck a flame upon the sole of his shoe, and applied it
      to the sheet of foolscap he still held in his hand. The two men watched it
      curl and blacken after it had been tossed in the grate, without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident had the effect of recalling to Thorpe the essentials of the
      situation. He had allowed the talk to drift to a point where it became
      almost affable. He sat upright with a sudden determination, and put his
      feet firmly on the floor, and knitted his brows in austerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not only a dirty trick that you tried to play me,&rdquo; he said, in an
      altered, harsh tone, &ldquo;but it was a fool-trick. That drunken old bum of a
      Tavender writes some lunatic nonsense or other to Gafferson, and he's a
      worse idiot even than Tavender is, and on the strength of what one of
      these clowns thinks he surmises the other clown means, you go and spend
      your money,&mdash;money I gave you, by the way,&mdash;in bringing Tavender
      over here. You do this on the double chance, we'll say, of using him
      against me for revenge and profit combined, or of peddling him to me for a
      still bigger profit. You see it's all at my fingers' ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden nodded an unqualified assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then&mdash;Tavender arrives. What do you do? Are you at the wharf to
      meet him? Have you said to yourself: 'I've set out to fight one of the
      smartest and strongest men in England, and I've got to keep every atom of
      wits about me, and strain every nerve to the utmost, and watch every point
      of the game as a tiger watches a snake'? Not a bit of it! You snooze in
      bed, and you send Gafferson&mdash;Gafferson!&mdash;the mud-head of the
      earth! to meet your Tavender, and loaf about with him in London, and bring
      him down by a slow train to your place in the evening. My God! You've only
      got two clear days left to do the whole thing in&mdash;and you don't even
      come up to town to get ready for them! You send Gafferson&mdash;and he
      goes off to see a flower-show&mdash;Mother of Moses! think of it! a
      FLOWER-show!&mdash;and your Tavender aud I are left to take a stroll
      together, and talk over old times and arrange about new times, and so on,
      to our hearts' content. Really, it's too easy! You make me tired!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nobleman offered a wan, appealing shadow of a smile. &ldquo;I confess to a
      certain degree of weariness myself,&rdquo; he said, humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe looked at him in his old apathetic, leaden fashion for a little. &ldquo;I
      may tell you that if you HAD got hold of Tavender,&rdquo; he decided to tell
      him, &ldquo;he shouldn't have been of the faintest use to you. I know what it
      was that he wrote to Gafferson,&mdash;I couldn't understand it when he
      first told me, but afterwards I saw through it,&mdash;and it was merely a
      maudlin misapprehension of his. He'd got three or four things all mixed up
      together. You've never met your friend Tavender, I believe? You'd enjoy
      him at Hadlow House. He smells of rum a hundred yards off. What little
      brain he's got left is soaked in it. The first time I was ever camping
      with him, I had to lick him for drinking the methylated spirits we were
      using with our tin stove. Oh, you'd have liked him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo; said Lord Plowden, upon reflection, &ldquo;it was all a most
      unfortunate and&mdash;ah&mdash;most deplorable mistake.&rdquo; With inspiration,
      he made bold to add: &ldquo;The most amazing thing, though&mdash;to my mind&mdash;is
      that you don't seem&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;particularly enraged
      with me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that surprises me, too,&rdquo; Thorpe meditatively admitted. &ldquo;I was
      entitled to kill you&mdash;crush you to jelly. Any other man I would. But
      you,&mdash;I don't know,&mdash;I do funny things with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would give me a drink, now&mdash;as one of them,&rdquo; Plowden
      ventured to suggest, with uneasy pleasantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe smiled a little as he rose, and heavily moved across the room. He
      set out upon the big official table in the middle, that mockingly
      pretentious reminder of a Board which never met, a decanter and two
      glasses and some recumbent, round-bottomed bottles. He handed one of these
      last to Plowden, as the latter strolled toward the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how to open these, don't you?&rdquo; he said, languidly. &ldquo;Somehow I
      never could manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nobleman submissively took the bottle, and picked with awkwardness at
      its wire and cork, and all at once achieved a premature and not
      over-successful explosion. He wiped his dripping cuff in silence, when the
      tumblers were supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;here's better luck to you next time,&rdquo; Thorpe said, lifting his
      glass. The audacious irony of his words filled Plowden with an instant
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth did you round on me in that way for, Thorpe&mdash;when I
      was here last?&rdquo; He put the question with bravery enough, but at sight of
      the other's unresponsive face grew suddenly timorous aud explanatory. &ldquo;No
      man was ever more astounded in the world than I was. To this day I'm as
      unable to account for it as a babe unborn. What conceivable thing had I
      done to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe slowly thought of something that had not occurred to him before,
      and seized upon it with a certain satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That day that you took me shooting,&rdquo; he said, with the tone of one
      finally exposing a long-nursed grievance, &ldquo;you stayed in bed for hours
      after you knew I was up and waiting for you&mdash;and when we went out,
      you had a servant to carry a chair for you, but I&mdash;by God!&mdash;I
      had to stand up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens above!&rdquo; ejaculated Plowden, in unfeigned amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are little things&mdash;mere trifles,&rdquo; continued Thorpe,
      dogmatically, &ldquo;but with men of my temper and make-up those are just the
      things that aggravate and rankle and hurt. Maybe it's foolish, but that's
      the kind of man I am. You ought to have had the intelligence to see that&mdash;and
      not let these stupid little things happen to annoy me. Why just think what
      you did. I was going to do God knows what for you&mdash;make your fortune
      and everything else,&mdash;and you didn't show consideration enough for me
      to get out of bed at a decent hour&mdash;much less see to it that I had a
      chair if you were going to have one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I can't tell how ashamed and sorry I am,&rdquo; Lord Plowden
      assured him, with fervent contrition in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, those are the things to guard against,&rdquo; said Thorpe, approaching a
      dismissal of the subject. &ldquo;People who show consideration for me; people
      who take pains to do the little pleasant things for me, and see that I'm
      not annoyed and worried by trifles&mdash;they're the people that I, on my
      side, do the big things for. I can be the best friend in the world, but
      only to those who show that they care for me, and do what they know I'll
      like. I don't want toadies about me, but I do want people who feel bound
      to me, and are as keen about me and my feelings and interests as they are
      about their own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is delightfully feudal&mdash;all this,&rdquo; commented the nobleman,
      smilingly addressing the remark to nobody in particular. Then he looked at
      Thorpe. &ldquo;Let me be one of them&mdash;one of the people you speak of,&rdquo; he
      said, with directness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe returned his look with the good-natured beginnings of a grin. &ldquo;But
      what would you be good for?&rdquo; he queried, in a bantering tone. &ldquo;People I
      have about me have to be of some use. They require to have heads on their
      shoulders. Why&mdash;just think what you've done. I don't mean so much
      about your letting Tavender slip through your fingers&mdash;although that
      was about the worst I ever heard of. But here in this room, at that desk
      there, you allowed me to bounce you into writing and signing a paper which
      you ought to have had your hand cut off rather than write, much less sign.
      You come here trying to work the most difficult and dangerous kind of a
      bluff,&mdash;knowing all the while that the witness you depended entirely
      upon had disappeared, you hadn't the remotest idea where,&mdash;and you
      actually let me lead you into giving me your signature to your own
      declaration that you are blackmailing me! Thinking it all over&mdash;you
      know&mdash;I can't see that you would be of much help to me in the City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden joined perforce in the laughter with which the big man
      enjoyed his own pleasantry. His mirth had some superficial signs of
      shamefacedness, but it was hopeful underneath. &ldquo;The City!&rdquo; he echoed, with
      meaning. &ldquo;That's the curse of it. What do I know about the City? What
      business have I in the City? As you said, I'm the amateur. A strong man
      like you can make me seem any kind of a ridiculous fool he likes, with the
      turn of his hand. I see that right enough. But what am I to do? I have to
      make a shot at something. I'm so rotten poor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe had retired again behind the barrier of dull-eyed abstraction. He
      seemed not to have heard this appealing explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other preserved silence in turn, and even made a pretence of looking
      at some pamphlets on the table, as a token of his boundless deference to
      the master's mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I'll see,&rdquo; the big man muttered at last, doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Plowden felt warranted in taking an optimistic view of these vague
      words. &ldquo;It's awfully good of you&rdquo;&mdash;he began, lamely, and then paused.
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo;&mdash;he took up a new thought with a more solicitous tone,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      wonder if you would mind returning to me that idiotic paper I signed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe shook his head. &ldquo;Not just now, at any rate,&rdquo; he said, still
      musingly. With his head bowed, he took a few restless steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are going to&mdash;to help me!&rdquo; the other remarked, with an air
      of confidence. He had taken up his hat, in response to the tacit warning
      of his companion's manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe looked at him curiously, and hesitated over his answer. It was a
      surprising and almost unaccountable conclusion for the interview to have
      reached. He was in some vague way ashamed of himself, but he was
      explicitly and contemptuously ashamed for Plowden, and the impulse to say
      so was strong within him. This handsome young gentleman of title ought not
      to be escaping with this restored buoyancy of mien, and this complacency
      of spirit. He had deserved to be punished with a heavy hand, and here he
      was blithely making certain of new benefits instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;I'll see,&rdquo; Thorpe moodily repeated&mdash;and there was
      no more to be said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN the noon hour of the following day was enacted the brief final scene in
      the drama of the &ldquo;Rubber Consols corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For long weeks, Mr. Stormont Thorpe had given much thought to this
      approaching climax of his great adventure&mdash;looking forward to it both
      as the crowning event of his life, and as the dawn of a new existence in
      some novel, enchanted world. It was to bring his triumph, and even more,
      his release. It was at once to crown him as a hero and chieftain among
      City men, and transfigure him into a being for whom all City things were
      an abomination. In his waking hours, the conflict between these aims did
      not specially force itself upon his attention: he mused upon, and spun
      fancies about, either one indifferently, and they seemed not at all
      irreconcilable. But his dreams were full of warfare,&mdash;wearily
      saturated with strife, and endless endeavour to do things which could not
      be done, and panic-stricken terrors before the shadow of shapeless
      calamities,&mdash;until he dreaded to go to sleep. Then he discovered that
      an extra two glasses of whiskey-and-water would solve that particular
      difficulty, and send him into prompt, leaden slumber&mdash;but the early
      mornings remained as torturing as ever. In the twilight he awoke oppressed
      and sick at heart with gloom&mdash;and then dozed at intervals through
      fantastic new ordeals of anguish and shame and fear, till it was decently
      possible to get up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, indeed, the big cold sponge on his head and spine scattered these
      foolish troubles like chaff, and restored to him his citizenship among the
      realities. He dressed with returning equanimity, and was almost cheerful
      by the time he thrust his razor into the hot water. Yet increasingly he
      was conscious of the wear and strain of it all, and increasingly the date,
      September twelfth, loomed before him with a portentous individuality of
      its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day grew to mean so much more to him than had all the other days of
      the dead years together that he woke in the darkness of its opening hours,
      and did not get satisfactorily to sleep again. His vigil, however, was for
      the once free from grief. He drowsily awaited the morning in vague mental
      comfort; he had recurring haphazard indolent glimpses of a protecting fact
      standing guard just outside the portals of consciousness&mdash;the fact
      that the great day was here. He rose early, breakfasted well, and walked
      by the Embankment to the City, where at ten he had a few words with
      Semple, and afterward caused himself to be denied to ordinary callers. He
      paced up and down the Board Room for the better part of the ensuing two
      hours, luxuriating in the general sense of satisfaction in the proximity
      of the climax, rather than pretending to himself that he was thinking out
      its details. He had provided in his plans of the day for a visit from
      Messrs. Rostocker and Aronson, which should constitute the dramatic finale
      of the &ldquo;corner,&rdquo; and he looked forward to this meeting with a certain
      eagerness of expectation. Yet even here he thought broadly of the scene as
      a whole, and asked himself no questions about words and phrases. It seemed
      to be taken for granted in his mind that the scene itself would be
      theatrically impressive, even spectacular.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event, this long-awaited culmination proved to be disappointingly
      flat and commonplace. It was over before Thorpe had said any considerable
      proportion of the things he saw afterward that he had intended to say. The
      two men came as he had expected they would&mdash;and they bought their way
      out of the tragic &ldquo;corner&rdquo; at precisely the price he had nominated in his
      mind. But hardly anything else went as he had dimly prefigured it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rostocker was a yellow-haired man, and Mr. Aronson was as dark as a
      Moor, and no physical resemblance of features or form suggested itself to
      the comparing eye, yet Thorpe even now, when they stood brusquely silent
      before him, with their carefully-brushed hats pulled down over their eyes,
      stuck to it in his own mind that it was hard to tell them apart. To the
      end, there was something impersonal in his feeling toward them. They, for
      their part, coldly abstained from exhibiting a sign of feeling about him,
      good, bad, or indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the man with the fair hair and little curly flaxen beard who spoke:
      &ldquo;How do you do! I understand that we can buy eight thousand five hundred
      Rubber Consols from you at 'twenty-three.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;twenty-five,&rdquo; replied Thorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark man spoke: &ldquo;The jobbers' price is twenty-three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To carry over&mdash;yes,&rdquo; Thorpe answered. &ldquo;But to buy it is
      twenty-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two sons of the race which invented mental arithmetic exchanged an
      alert glance, and looked at the floor for an engrossed instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind telling you,&rdquo; Thorpe interposed upon their silence, &ldquo;I put
      on that extra two pounds because you got up that story about applying to
      the Stock Exchange Committee on a charge of fraud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn't get up any story,&rdquo; said Rostocker, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tried to plant it on us,&rdquo; Aronson declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of your own Directors put it about. I thought it was a fake at the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This view of the episode took Thorpe by surprise. As it seemed, in
      passing, to involve a compliment to his own strategic powers, he accepted
      it without comment. &ldquo;Well&mdash;it is twenty-five, anyway,&rdquo; he told them,
      with firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-four,&rdquo; suggested Aronson, after another momentary pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a shilling less than twenty-five,&rdquo; Thorpe insisted, with quiet
      doggedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can always pay our creditors and let you whistle,&rdquo; Rostocker reminded
      him, laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do anything you like,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;except buy Rubber Consols
      under twenty-five. It doesn't matter a fig to me whether you go bankrupt
      or not. It would suit me as well to have you two 'hammered' as to take
      your money.&rdquo; Upon the spur of a sudden thought he drew out his watch. &ldquo;In
      just two minutes' time to a tick, the price will be thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's be 'hammered' then!&rdquo; said Aronson to his companion, with simulated
      impulsiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rostocker was the older and stronger man, and when at last he spoke it was
      with the decision of one in authority. &ldquo;It is your game,&rdquo; he said, with
      grave imperturbability. &ldquo;Eight thousand five hundred at twenty-five. Will
      you deliver at the Credit Lyonnais in half an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe nodded, impassively. Then a roving idea of genial impertinence
      brought a gleam to his eye. &ldquo;If you should happen to want more Rubber
      Consols at any time,&rdquo; he said, with a tentative chuckle, &ldquo;I could probably
      let you have them at a reduced price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two received the pleasantry without a smile, but to Thorpe's
      astonishment one of them seemed to discern something in it beside banter.
      It was Rostocker who said: &ldquo;Perhaps we may make a deal with you,&rdquo; and
      apparently meant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out at this, ignoring ceremony upon their exit as stolidly as
      they had done upon their entrance, and a moment later Thorpe called in the
      Secretary, and despatched a messenger to bring Semple from Capel Court.
      The formalities of this final transfer of shares had been dictated to the
      former, and he had gone off on the business, before the Broker arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe stood waiting near the door, and held out his hand with a
      dramatically significant gesture when the little Scotchman entered. &ldquo;Put
      her there!&rdquo; he exclaimed heartily, with an exuberant reversion to the
      slang of remote transatlantic bonhomie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeh've done it, then!&rdquo; said Semple, his sharp face softening with
      pleasure at the news. &ldquo;Yeh've pulled it off at twenty-three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other's big countenance yielded itself to a boyish grin.
      &ldquo;Twenty-FIVE!&rdquo; he said, and laughed aloud. &ldquo;After you left this morning,
      it kind o' occurred to me that I'd raise it a couple of pounds. I found I
      was madder about those pieces in the newspapers than I thought I was, and
      so I took an extra seventeen thousand pounds on that account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God above!&rdquo; Semple ejaculated, with a satisfaction through which signs of
      an earlier fright were visible. &ldquo;It was touch-and-go if you didn't lose it
      all by doing that! You risked everything, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe ponderously shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Well&mdash;I did it, anyhow,
      and it came off,&rdquo; was his comment. Then, straightening himself, he drew a
      long, long breath, and beamed down at the little man. &ldquo;Think of it! God!
      It's actually all over! And NOW perhaps we won't have a drink! Hell! Let's
      send out for some champagne!&rdquo; His finger was hovering over the bell, when
      the Broker's dissuading voice arrested it. &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Semple urged. &ldquo;I
      wouldn't touch it. It's no fit drink for the daytime&mdash;and it's a
      scandal in an office. Your clerks will aye blab it about hither and yon,
      and nothing harms a man's reputation more in the City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to hell with the City!&rdquo; cried Thorpe, joyously. &ldquo;I'm never going to
      set foot in it again. Think of that! I mean it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      None the less, he abandoned the idea of sending out for wine, and
      contented himself with the resources of the cabinet instead. After some
      friendly pressure, Semple consented to join him in a brandy-and-soda,
      though he continued to protest between sips that at such an hour it was an
      indecent practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the ruin of many a strong man,&rdquo; he moralized, looking rather
      pointedly at Thorpe over his glass. &ldquo;It's the principal danger that besets
      the verra successful man. He's too busily occupied to take exercise, and
      he's too anxious and worried to get his proper sleep&mdash;but he can
      always drink! In one sense, I'm not sorry to think that you're leaving the
      City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it never hurts me,&rdquo; Thorpe said, indifferently accepting the
      direction of the homily. &ldquo;I'm as strong as an ox. But all the same, I
      shall be better in every way for getting out of this hole. Thank God, I
      can get off to Scotland tomorrow. But I say, Semple, what's the matter
      with your visiting me at my place there? I'll give you the greatest
      shooting and fishing you ever heard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Broker was thinking of something else. &ldquo;What is to be the precise
      position of the Company, in the immediate future?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Company? What Company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Semple smiled grimly. &ldquo;Have you already forgotten that there is such a
      thing?&rdquo; he queried, with irony. &ldquo;Why, man, this Company that paid for this
      verra fine Board-table,&rdquo; he explained, with his knuckles on its red baize
      centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe laughed amusedly. &ldquo;I paid for that out of my own pocket,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;For that matter everything about the Company has come out of my pocket&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or gone into it,&rdquo; suggested the other, and they chuckled together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no&mdash;you're right,&rdquo; Thorpe declared. &ldquo;Some thing ought to be
      settled about the Company, I suppose. Of course I wash my hands of it&mdash;but
      would anybody else want to go on with it? You see its annual working
      expenses, merely for the office and the Board, foot up nearly 3,000
      pounds. I've paid these for this year, but naturally I won't do it again.
      And would it be worth anybody else's while to do it? Yours, for example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had any explanations with the other Directors?&rdquo; the Broker
      asked, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explanations&mdash;no,&rdquo; Thorpe told him. &ldquo;But that's all right. The
      Marquis has been taken care of, and so has Plowden. They're game to agree
      to anything. And let's see&mdash;Kervick is entirely my man. That leaves
      Watkin and Davidson&mdash;and they don't matter. They're mere guinea-pigs.
      A few hundreds apiece would shut them up, if you thought it was worth
      while to give them anything at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And about the property,&mdash;the rubber plantation,&mdash;that the
      Company was formed to acquire and develop. I suppose there really is such
      a plantation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it's all there right enough,&rdquo; Thorpe said, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no good, though, is it?&rdquo; the Broker asked, with affable directness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between ourselves, it isn't worth a damn,&rdquo; the other blithely assured
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scotchman mused with bent brows. &ldquo;There ought still to be money in
      it,&rdquo; he said, with an air of conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; it occurred to Thorpe to mention, &ldquo;here's something I didn't
      understand. I told Rostocker here, just as a cheeky kind of joke, that
      after he and Aronson had got their eight thousand five hundred, if they
      thought they'd like still more shares, I'd let 'em have 'em at a bargain&mdash;and
      he seemed to take it seriously. He did for a fact. Said perhaps he could
      make a deal with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm-m!&rdquo; said Semple, reflectively. &ldquo;I'll see if he says anything to me.
      Very likely he's spotted some way of taking the thing over, and
      reorganizing it, and giving it another run over the course. I'll think it
      out. And now I must be off. Aren't you lunching?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I'll have the boy bring in some sandwiches,&rdquo; Thorpe decided. &ldquo;I
      want my next meal west of Temple Bar when I get round to it. I've soured
      on the City for keeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't say that it had been so bad to you, either,&rdquo; Semple smilingly
      suggested, as he turned to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe grinned in satisfied comment. &ldquo;Hurry back as soon as you've finally
      settled with Rostocker and the other fellow,&rdquo; he called after him, and
      began pacing the floor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly four o'clock when these two men, again together in the Board
      Room, and having finished the inspection of some papers on the desk, sat
      upright and looked at each other in tacit recognition that final words
      were to be spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Semple,&rdquo; Thorpe began, after that significant little pause, &ldquo;I want
      to say that I'm damned glad you've done so well for yourself in this
      affair. You've been as straight as a die to me,&mdash;I owe it as much to
      you as I do to myself,&mdash;and if you don't think you've got enough even
      now, I want you to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken in tones of sincere liking, and the other answered him in
      kind. &ldquo;I have more than I ever dreamed of making in a lifetime when I came
      to London,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;If my father were alive, and heard me tell him
      that in one year, out of a single transaction, I had cleared over
      sixty-five thousand pounds, he'd be fit to doubt the existence of a
      Supreme Being. I'm obliged to you for your good words, Thorpe. It's not
      only been profitable to work with you, but it has been a great education
      and a great pleasure as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe nodded his appreciation. &ldquo;I'm going to ask a favour of you,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I want to leave the general run of my investments and interests
      here in your hands, to keep track of I don't want to speculate at all, in
      the ordinary meaning of the word. Even after I bury a pot of money in
      non-productive real estate, I shall have an income of 50,000 pounds at the
      very least, and perhaps twice as much. There's no fun in gambling when
      you've got such a bank as that behind you. But if there are good, wise
      changes to be made in investments, or if things turn up in the way of
      chances that I ought to know about, I want to feel that you're on the spot
      watching things and doing things in my interest. And as it won't be
      regular broker's work, I shall want to pay you a stated sum&mdash;whatever
      you think is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will arrange itself easily enough,&rdquo; said Semple. &ldquo;I shall have the
      greatest pleasure in caring for whatever you put in my hands. And I think
      I can promise that it will be none the worse for the keeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't need any assurance on that score,&rdquo; Thorpe declared, cordially.
      &ldquo;You're the one sterling, honest man I've known in the City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the Broker's turn to make a little acknowledging bow. His eyes
      gleamed frank satisfaction at being so well understood. &ldquo;I think I see the
      way that more money can be made out of the Company,&rdquo; he said, abruptly
      changing the subject. &ldquo;I've had but a few words with Rostocker about it&mdash;but
      it's clear to me that he has a plan. He will be coming to you with a
      proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he won't find me, then,&rdquo; interposed Thorpe, with a comfortable
      smile. &ldquo;I leave all that to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect that his plan,&rdquo; continued Semple, &ldquo;is to make a sub-rosa offer
      of a few shillings for the majority of the shares, and reconstitute the
      Board, and then form another Company to buy the property and good-will of
      the old one at a handsome price. Now if that would be a good thing for him
      to do, it would be a good thing for me to do. I shall go over it all
      carefully, in detail, this evening. And I suppose, if I see my way clear
      before me, than I may rely upon your good feeling in the matter. I would
      do all the work and assume all the risk, and, let us say, divide any
      profits equally&mdash;you in turn giving me a free hand with all your
      shares, and your influence with the Directors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do better still,&rdquo; Thorpe told him, upon brief reflection.
      &ldquo;Reconstitute the Board and make Lord Plowden Chairman,&mdash;I don't
      imagine the Marquis would have the nerve to go on with it,&mdash;and I'll
      make a free gift of my shares to you two&mdash;half and half. You'll find
      him all right to work with,&mdash;if you can only get him up in the
      morning,&mdash;and I've kind o' promised him something of the sort. Does
      that suit you?&rdquo; Semple's countenance was thoughtful rather than
      enthusiastic. &ldquo;I'm more skeptical about Lords than you are,&rdquo; he observed,
      &ldquo;but if he's amenable, and understands that his part is to do what I tell
      him to do, I've no doubt we shall hit it off together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, absolutely!&rdquo; said Thorpe, with confidence. &ldquo;I'll see to it that he
      behaves like a lamb. You're to have an absolutely free hand. You're to do
      what you like,&mdash;wind the Company up, or sell it out, or rig it up
      under a new name and catch a new set of gudgeons with it,&mdash;whatever
      you damned please. When I trust a man, I trust him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two friends, their faces brightened and their voices mellowed by this
      serene consciousness of their mutual trust in each other's loyalty and
      integrity, dwelt no further upon these halcyon beginnings of a fresh plan
      for plundering the public. They spoke instead on personal topics&mdash;of
      the possibility of Semple's coming to Scotland during the autumn, and of
      the chance of Thorpe's wintering abroad. All at once Thorpe found himself
      disclosing the fact of his forthcoming marriage, though he did not mention
      the name of the lady's father, and under the gracious stress of this
      announcement they drank again, and clinked glasses fervently. When Semple
      at last took his leave, they shook hands with the deep-eyed earnestness of
      comrades who have been through battle and faced death together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until Thorpe stood alone that the full realizing sense of what
      the day meant seemed to come to him. Fruition was finally complete: the
      last winnowing of the great harvest had been added to the pile. Positively
      nothing remained for him but to enter and enjoy!
    </p>
    <p>
      He found it curiously difficult to grasp the thought in its entirety. He
      stood the master of unlimited leisure for the rest of his life, and of
      power to enrich that life with everything that money could buy,&mdash;but
      there was an odd inability to feel about it as he knew he ought to feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, for some unaccountable reason, an absurd depression hovered about
      over his mind, darkening it with formless shadows. It was as if he were
      sorry that the work was all finished&mdash;that there was nothing more for
      him to do. But that was too foolish, and he tried to thrust it from him.
      He said with angry decision to himself that he had never liked the work;
      that it had all been unpleasant and grinding drudgery, tolerable only as a
      means to an end; that now this end had been reached, he wanted never to
      lay eyes on the City again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let him dwell instead upon the things he did want to lay eyes upon. Some
      travel no doubt he would like, but not too much; certainly no more than
      his wife would cheerfully accept as a minimum. He desired rather to rest
      among his own possessions. To be lord of the manor at Pellesley Court,
      with his own retinue of servants and dependents and tenants, his own
      thousands of rich acres, his own splendid old timber, his own fat stock
      and fleet horses and abundant covers and prize kennels&mdash;THAT was what
      most truly appealed to him. It was not at all certain that he would hunt;
      break-neck adventure in the saddle scarcely attracted him. But there was
      no reason in the world why he should not breed racing horses, and create
      for himself a distinguished and even lofty position on the Turf. He had
      never cared much about races or racing folk himself, but when the Prince
      and Lord Rosebery and people like that went in for winning the Derby,
      there clearly must be something fascinating in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Parliament, of course; he did not waver at all from his old if vague
      conception of a seat in Parliament as a natural part of the outfit of a
      powerful country magnate. And in a hundred other ways men should think of
      him as powerful, and look up to him. He would go to church every Sunday,
      and sit in the big Squire's pew. He would be a magistrate as a matter of
      course, and he would make himself felt on the County Council. He would
      astonish the county by his charities, and in bad years by the munificence
      of his reductions in rents. Perhaps if there were a particularly bad
      harvest, he would decline all over his estate to exact any rent whatever.
      Fancy what a noble sensation that would make! A Duke could do no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very clear to him now that he desired to have children of his own,&mdash;say
      two at least, a son and a daughter, or perhaps a son and two daughters:
      two little girls would be company for each other. As he prefigured these
      new beings, the son was to exist chiefly for purposes of distinction and
      the dignity of heirship, and the paternal relations with him would be
      always somewhat formal, and, though affectionate, unexpansive. But the
      little girls&mdash;they would put their arms round their father's neck,
      and walk out with him to see the pigs and the dogs, and be the darlings of
      his heart. He would be an old man by the time they grew up.
    </p>
    <p>
      A beatific vision of himself took form in his mind&mdash;of himself
      growing grey and pleasurably tired, surrounded by opulence and the
      demonstrative respect of everybody, smiling with virtuous content as he
      strolled along between his two daughters, miracles of beauty and
      tenderness, holding each by a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of a clerk broke abruptly upon this daydream. He had a
      telegram in his hand, and Thorpe, rousing himself with an effort, took the
      liver-coloured envelope, and looked blankly at it. Some weird apprehension
      seized upon him, as if he belonged to the peasant class which
      instinctively yokes telegrams and calamities together. He deferred to this
      feeling enough to nod dismissal to the clerk, and then, when he was again
      alone, slowly opened the message, and read it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Newcastle-on-Tyne, September 12. Our friend died at Edinboro this
      morning. See you at hotel this evening.&mdash;Kervick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Thorpe felt at first was that his two daughters had shrunk from him
      with swift, terrible aversion: they vanished, along with every phase of
      the bright vision, under a pall of unearthly blackness. He stood in the
      centre of a chill solitude, staring stupidly at the coarse, soft paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The premonition, then, had justified itself! Something had told him that
      the telegram was an evil thing. A vaguely superstitious consciousness of
      being in the presence of Fate laid hold upon him. His great day of triumph
      had its blood-stain. A victim had been needful&mdash;and to that end poor
      simple, silly old Tavender was a dead man. Thorpe could see him,&mdash;an
      embarrassing cadaver eyed by strangers who did not know what to do with
      it,&mdash;fatuous even in death.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden rage at Kervick flamed up. He clearly had played the fool&mdash;clumsily
      over-plying the simpleton with drink till he had killed him. The shadow of
      murder indubitably hung over the thing. And then&mdash;the crass
      witlessness of telegraphing! Already, doubtless, the police of Edinborough
      were talking over the wires with Scotland Yard. A reference to a death in
      Edinborough, in a telegram from Newcastle&mdash;it was incredible that
      this should escape the eye of the authorities. Any minute might bring a
      detective through that door there&mdash;following into the Board Room with
      his implacable scent the clue of blood. Thorpe's fancy pictured this
      detective as a momentarily actual presence&mdash;tall, lean, cold-eyed,
      mysteriously calm and fatally wise, the omniscient terror of the magazine
      short-stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned faint and sick under a spasm of fright. The menace of enquiry
      became something more than a threat: he felt it, like the grip of a
      constable upon his arm. Everything would be mercilessly unravelled. The
      telegram of the idiot Kervick would bring the police down upon him like a
      pack of beagles. The beliefs and surmises of the idiot Gafferson would
      furnish them with the key to everything. He would have his letter from
      Tavender to show to the detectives&mdash;and the Government's smart
      lawyers would ferret out the rest. The death of Tavender&mdash;they could
      hardly make him responsible for that; but it was the dramatic feature of
      this death which would inspire them all to dig up everything about the
      fraud. It was this same sensational added element of the death, too, which
      would count with a jury. They were always gross, sentimental fools, these
      juries. They would mix up the death and the deal in Rubber Consols, and in
      their fat-headed confusion would say &ldquo;Penal Servitude&mdash;fourteen
      years.&rdquo; Or no, it was the Judge who fixed that. But the Judges were fools,
      too; they were too conceited, too puffed up with vanity, to take the
      trouble to understand. He groaned aloud in a nightmare of helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of his own voice, moaning in his ears, had a magical effect upon
      him. He lifted his head, gazed about him, and then flushed deeply. His
      nerveless cowardice had all at once become unbelievable to himself. With a
      shamed frown he straightened himself, and stood thus for a long minute,
      engrossed in the definite task of chasing these phantoms from his mind.
      Once a manly front was displayed to them, they slunk away with miraculous
      facility. He poured out some brandy, and sipped it neat, and laughed
      scornfully, defiantly, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had over half a million&mdash;with power and force and courage enough
      to do with it what he liked. He had fought luck undauntedly, unwearyingly,
      during all those years when his hands were empty. Was he to tremble and
      turn tail now, when his hands were full, when he was armoured and weaponed
      at every point? He was amazed and hurt, and still more enraged, at that
      fit of girlish weakness which had possessed him. He could have beaten
      himself with stripes for it. But it could never happen again&mdash;never,
      never!
    </p>
    <p>
      He told himself that with proud, resolute reiteration, as he got his hat
      and stick, and put in his pockets one or two papers from the desk, and
      then glanced about the Board Room for what was, most likely, the last
      time. Here he had won his great victory over Fate, here he had put his
      enemies under his feet, and if innocent simpletons had wandered into the
      company of these foes, it mattered not a whit to him that they also had
      been crushed. Figuratively, he turned his back upon them now; he left
      them, slain and trampled, in the Board Room behind him. They no longer
      concerned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figuratively, too, as he walked with firmness to the door, he stepped over
      the body of old Tavender, upon the threshold, and bestowed upon it a
      downward mental glance, and passed on. By the time he reached the street,
      the memory of Tavender had become the merest shred of a myth. As he strode
      on, it seemed to him that his daughters came again, and took his hands,
      and moved lovingly beside him&mdash;lovingly and still more admiringly
      than before.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      BY the autumn of the following year, a certain small proportion of the
      people inhabiting the district in Hertfordshire which set its clocks by
      the dial over the stable-tower of Pellesley Court had accustomed
      themselves to give the place its new name of High Thorpe. These were for
      the most part the folk of peculiarly facile wits and ready powers of
      adaptation, like pushing small tradesmen, and the upper servants in county
      houses. An indolent and hazy compromise upon Pellesley Thorpe had drifted
      into use by perhaps a larger number. To the puzzled conservatism of the
      abiding huge majority nearest to the soil&mdash;the round-backed, lumpish
      men who tie strings round their corduroys under the knee, and the strong,
      cow-faced women who look at passers-by on the road from the doors of dark
      little cottages, over radiant patches of blossoming garden&mdash;it seemed
      safest to drop family names altogether, and call it merely the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stood proudly upon what was rather a notable elevation for those flat
      parts&mdash;a massive mansion of simple form, built of a grey stone which
      seemed at a distance almost white against the deep background of yews and
      Italian pines behind it. For many miles seaward this pale front was a
      landmark. From the terrace-walk at its base, one beheld a great expanse of
      soft green country, sloping gently away for a long distance, then
      stretching out upon a level which on misty days was interminable. In
      bright weather, the remote, low-lying horizon had a defining line of
      brownish-blue&mdash;and this stood for what was left of a primitive
      forest, containing trees much older than the Norman name it bore. It was a
      forest which at some time, no doubt, had extended without a break till it
      merged into that of Epping&mdash;leagues away to the south. The modern
      clearance and tillage, however, which separated it now from Epping had
      served as a curiously effective barrier&mdash;more baffling than the
      Romans and Angles in their turn had found the original wildwood. No
      stranger seemed ever to find his way into that broad, minutely-cultivated
      fertile plain which High Thorpe looked down upon. No railway had pushed
      its cheapening course across it. Silent, embowered old country roads and
      lanes netted its expanse with hedgerows; red points of tiled roofs,
      distinguishable here and there in clusters among the darker greens of
      orchards, identified the scattered hamlets&mdash;all named in Domesday
      Book, all seemingly unchanged since. A grey square church-tower emerging
      from the rooks' nests; an ordered mass of foliage sheltering the distant
      gables and chimneys of some isolated house; the dim perception on occasion
      that a rustic waggon was in motion on some highway, crawling patiently
      like an insect&mdash;of this placid, inductive nature were all the added
      proofs of human occupation that the landscape offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stormont Thorpe, on an afternoon of early October, yawned in the face
      of this landscape&mdash;and then idly wondered a little at the mood which
      had impelled him to do so. At the outset of his proprietorship he had
      bound himself, as by a point of honour, to regard this as the finest view
      from any gentleman's house in England. During the first few months his
      fidelity had been taxed a good deal, but these temptations and struggles
      lay now all happily behind him. He had satisfactorily assimilated the
      spirit of the vista, and blended it with his own. Its inertia, when one
      came to comprehend it, was undeniably magnificent, and long ago he had
      perceived within himself the growth of an answering repose, a responsive
      lethargy, which in its full development was also going to be very fine.
      Practically all the land this side of the impalpable line where trees and
      houses began to fade into the background belonged to him; there were whole
      villages nestling half-concealed under its shrubberies which were his
      property. As an investment, these possessions were extremely
      unremunerative. Indeed, if one added the cost of the improvements which
      ought to be made, to the expenditure already laid out in renovations, it
      was questionable if for the next twenty years they would not represent a
      deficit on the income-sheet. But, now that he had laid hold of the local
      character, it pleased him that it should be so. He would not for the world
      have his gentle, woolly-minded, unprofitable cottagers transformed into
      &ldquo;hustlers&rdquo;; it would wound his eye to see the smoke of any commercial
      chimney, the smudge of any dividend-paying factory, staining the pure
      tints of the sylvan landscape. He had truly learned to love it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet now, as he strolled on the terrace with his first after-luncheon
      cigar, he unaccountably yawned at the thing he loved. Upon reflection, he
      had gone to bed rather earlier the previous evening than usual. He had not
      been drinking out of the ordinary; his liver seemed right enough. He was
      not conscious of being either tired or drowsy. He looked again at the view
      with some fixity, and said to himself convincingly that nothing else in
      England could compare with it. It was the finest thing there was anywhere.
      Then he surprised himself in the middle of another yawn&mdash;and halted
      abruptly. It occurred to him that he wanted to travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since his home-coming to this splendid new home in the previous January,
      at the conclusion of a honeymoon spent in Algiers and Egypt, he had not
      been out of England. There had been a considerable sojourn in London, it
      is true, at what was described to him as the height of the Season, but
      looking back upon it, he could not think of it as a diversion. It had been
      a restless, over-worked, mystifying experience, full of dinners to people
      whom he had never seen before, and laborious encounters with other people
      whom he did not particularly want to see again. There had been no physical
      comfort in it for him, and little more mental satisfaction, for Londoners,
      or rather people in London, seemed all to be making an invidious
      distinction in their minds between him and his wife. The fact that she
      continued to be called Lady Cressage was not of itself important to him.
      But in the incessant going about in London, their names were called out
      together so often that his ear grew sensitive and sore to the touch of the
      footmen's reverberations. The meaning differentiation which the voices of
      the servants insisted upon, seemed inevitably reflected in the glance and
      manner of their mistresses. More than anything else, that made him hate
      London, and barred the doors of his mind to all thoughts of buying a
      town-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      His newly-made wife, it is true, had not cared much for London, either,
      and had agreed to his decision against a town-house almost with animation.
      The occasion of their return from the hot bustle of the metropolis to
      these cool home shades&mdash;in particular the minute in which, at a bend
      in the winding carriage-way down below, they had silently regarded
      together the spectacle uplifted before them, with the big, welcoming
      house, and the servants on the terrace&mdash;had a place of its own in his
      memory. Edith had pressed his arm, as they sat side by side in the landau,
      on the instant compulsion of a feeling they had in common. He had never,
      before or since, had quite the same assurance that she shared an emotion
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very far, however, from finding fault with his wife. It was in the
      nature of the life he chose to lead that he should see a great deal of
      her, and think a great deal about her, and she bore both tests admirably.
      If there was a fault to be found, it was with himself for his inability to
      altogether understand her. She played the part she had undertaken to play
      with abundant skill and discretion and grace, and even with an air of nice
      good-fellowship which had some of the aspects of affection. He was vaguely
      annoyed with himself for having insight enough to perceive that it was a
      part she was playing, and yet lacking the added shrewdness to divine what
      her own personal attitude to her role was like. He had noticed sometimes
      the way good women looked at their husbands when the latter were talking
      over their heads&mdash;with the eager, intent, non-comprehending
      admiration of an affectionate dog. This was a look which he could not
      imagine himself discovering in his wife's eves. It was not conceivable to
      him that he should talk over her head. Her glance not only revealed an
      ample understanding of all he said, but suggested unused reserves of
      comprehension which he might not fathom. It was as if, intellectually no
      less than socially, she possessed a title and he remained an
      undistinguished plebeian.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no grievance, however, even in his own thoughts, of either
      inequality. She had been charmingly frank and fair about the question of
      the names, when it first arose. The usage had latterly come to be, she
      explained, for a widow bearing even a courtesy title derived from her late
      husband, to retain it on marrying again. It was always the easiest course
      to fall in with usage, but if he had any feelings on the subject, and
      preferred to have her insist on being called Mrs. Thorpe, she would meet
      his wishes with entire willingness. It had seemed to him, as to her, that
      it was wisest to allow usage to settle the matter. Some months after their
      marriage there appeared in the papers what purported to be an
      authoritative announcement that the Queen objected to the practice among
      ladies who married a second time, of retaining titles acquired by the
      earlier marriages, and that the lists of precedency at Buckingham Palace
      would henceforth take this into account. Lady Cressage showed this to her
      husband, and talked again with candour on the subject. She said she had
      always rather regretted the decision they originally came to, and even now
      could wish that it might be altered, but that to effect a change in the
      face of this newspaper paragraph would seem servile&mdash;and in this as
      in most other things he agreed with her. As she said, they wanted nothing
      of Buckingham Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted equally little, it seemed, of the society which the
      neighbouring district might afford. There was a meagre routine of formal
      calls kept in languid operation, Thorpe knew, but it was so much in the
      background that he never came in contact with it. His own notions of the
      part he ought to take in County affairs had undergone a silent and
      unnoted, yet almost sweeping, change. What little he saw of the gentry and
      strong local men with whom he would have to work, quietly undermined and
      dismantled all his ambitions in that direction. They were not his sort;
      their standards for the measurement of things were unintelligible to him.
      He did not doubt that, if he set himself about it, he could impose his
      dominion upon them, any more than he doubted that, if he mastered the
      Chinese language, he could lift himself to be a Mandarin, but the one
      would be as unnatural and unattractive an enterprise as the other. He came
      to be upon nodding terms with most of the &ldquo;carriage-people&rdquo; round about;
      some few he exchanged meaningless words with upon occasion, and understood
      that his wife also talked with, when it was unavoidable, but there his
      relationship to the County ended, and he was well pleased that it should
      be so. It gave him a deep satisfaction to see that his wife seemed also
      well pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      He used the word &ldquo;seemed&rdquo; in his inmost musings, for it was never quite
      certain what really did please and displease her. It was always puzzling
      to him to reconcile her undoubted intellectual activity with the practical
      emptiness of the existence she professed to enjoy. In one direction, she
      had indeed a genuine outlet for her energies, which he could understand
      her regarding in the light of an occupation. She was crazier about flowers
      and plants than anybody he had ever heard of, and it had delighted him to
      make over to her, labelled jocosely as the bouquet-fund, a sum of money
      which, it seemed to him, might have paid for the hanging-gardens of
      Babylon. It yielded in time&mdash;emerging slowly but steadily from a
      prodigious litter of cement and bricks and mortar and putty, under the
      hands of innumerable masons, carpenters, glaziers, plumbers, and
      nondescript subordinates, all of whom talked unwearyingly about nothing at
      all, and suffered no man to perform any part of his allotted task without
      suspending their own labours to watch him&mdash;an imposing long line of
      new greenhouses, more than twenty in number. The mail-bag was filled
      meanwhile with nurserymen's catalogues, and the cart made incessant
      journeys to and from Punsey station, bringing back vast straw-enwrapped
      baskets and bundles and boxes beyond counting, the arrival and unpacking
      of which was with Edith the event of the day. About the reality of her
      engrossed interest in all the stages of progress by which these
      greenhouses became crowded museums of the unusual and abnormal in
      plant-life, it was impossible to have any suspicion. And even after they
      were filled to overflowing, Thorpe noted with joy that this interest
      seemed in no wise to flag. She spent hours every day under the glass,
      exchanging comments and theories with her gardeners, and even pulling
      things about with her own hands, and other hours she devoted almost as
      regularly to supervising the wholesale alterations that had been begun in
      the gardens outside. There were to be new paths, new walls with a southern
      exposure, new potting sheds, new forcing pits, new everything&mdash;and in
      the evenings she often worked late over the maps and plans she drew for
      all this. Thorpe's mind found it difficult to grasp the idea that a lady
      of such notable qualities could be entirely satisfied by a career among
      seeds and bulbs and composts, but at least time brought no evidences of a
      decline in her horticultural zeal. Who knew? Perhaps it might go on
      indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for himself, he had got on very well without any special inclination or
      hobby. He had not done any of the great things that a year ago it had
      seemed to him he would forthwith do&mdash;but his mind was serenely
      undisturbed by regrets. He did not even remember with any distinctness
      what these things were that he had been going to do. The routine of life&mdash;as
      arranged and borne along by the wise and tactful experts who wore the
      livery of High Thorpe&mdash;was abundantly sufficient in itself. He slept
      well now in the morning hours, and though he remained still, by
      comparison, an early riser, the bath and the shaving and slow dressing
      under the hands of a valet consumed comfortably a good deal of time.
      Throughout the day he was under the almost constant observation of people
      who were calling him &ldquo;master&rdquo; in their minds, and watching to see how, in
      the smallest details of deportment, a &ldquo;master&rdquo; carried himself, and the
      consciousness of this alone amounted to a kind of vocation. The house
      itself made demands upon him nearly as definite as those of the servants.
      It was a house of huge rooms, high ceilings, and grandiose fireplaces and
      stairways, which had seemed to him like a royal palace when he first
      beheld it, and still produced upon him an effect of undigestible largeness
      and strangeness. It was as a whole not so old as the agents had
      represented it, by some centuries, but it adapted itself as little to his
      preconceived notions of domesticity as if it had been built by Druids. The
      task of seeming to be at home in it had as many sides to it as there were
      minutes in the day&mdash;and oddly enough, Thorpe found in their study and
      observance a congenial occupation. Whether he was reading in the library&mdash;where
      there was an admirable collection of books of worth&mdash;or walking over
      the home-farms, or driving in his smart stanhope with the coachman behind,
      or sitting in formal costume and dignity opposite his beautiful wife at
      the dinner-table, the sense of what was expected of him was there,
      steadying and restraining, like an atmospheric pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far they had had few visitors, and had accepted no invitations to
      join house-parties elsewhere. They agreed without speaking about it that
      it was more their form to entertain than to be entertained, and certain
      people were coming to them later in the month. These were quite wholly of
      Edith's set and selection, for Thorpe had no friends or acquaintances
      outside her circle for whose presence he had any desire&mdash;and among
      these prospective guests were a Duke and a Duchess. Once, such a fact
      would have excited Thorpe's imagination. He regarded it now as something
      appropriate under the circumstances, and gave it little further thought.
      His placid, satisfied life was not dependent upon the stir of guests
      coming and going, even though they were the great of the earth. He walked
      on his spacious terrace after luncheon&mdash;a tall, portly, well-groomed
      figure of a man, of relaxed, easy aspect, with his big cigar, and his
      panama hat, and his loose clothes of choice fabrics and exquisite
      tailoring&mdash;and said to himself that it was the finest view in England&mdash;and
      then, to his own surprise, caught himself in the act of yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      From under the silk curtains and awning of a window-doorway at the end of
      the terrace, his wife issued and came toward him. Her head was bare, and
      she had the grace and fresh beauty of a young girl in her simple light
      gown of some summery figured stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to going off somewhere&mdash;tomorrow if you like&mdash;travelling
      abroad?&rdquo; he called out, as she approached him. The idea, only a moment old
      in his mind, had grown to great proportions. &ldquo;How can we?&rdquo; she asked, upon
      the briefest thought. &ldquo;THEY are coming at the end of the week. This is
      Monday, and they arrive on the 12th&mdash;that's this Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon as that!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought it was later. H-m! I don't
      know&mdash;I think perhaps I'll go up to London this evening. I'm by way
      of feeling restless all at once. Will you come up with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I can't think of anything in London that would be
      tolerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a vague little laugh. &ldquo;I shall probably hate it myself when I get
      there,&rdquo; he speculated. &ldquo;There isn't anybody I want to see&mdash;there
      isn't anything I want to do. I don' t know&mdash;perhaps it might liven me
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face took on a look of enquiring gravity. &ldquo;Are you getting tired of
      it, then?&rdquo; She put the question gently, almost cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected a little. &ldquo;Why&mdash;no,&rdquo; he answered, as if reasoning to
      himself. &ldquo;Of course I'm not. This is what I've always wanted. It's my idea
      of life to a 't.' Only&mdash;I suppose everything needs a break in it now
      and then&mdash;if only for the comfort of getting back into the old rut
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rut&mdash;yes,&rdquo; she commented, musingly. &ldquo;Apparently there's always a
      rut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe gave her the mystified yet uncomplaining glance she knew so well in
      his eyes. For once, the impulse to throw hidden things up into his range
      of view prevailed with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, with a confused half-smile at the novelty of her
      mood for elucidation, &ldquo;I fancied a rut was the one thing there could be no
      question about with you. I had the notion that you were incapable of ruts&mdash;and
      conventional grooves. I thought you&mdash;as Carlyle puts it&mdash;I
      thought you were a man who had swallowed all the formulas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe looked down at his stomach doubtfully. &ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; he
      said at last, but in a tone without any note of conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; she told him, with light readiness&mdash;&ldquo;for I don't see
      myself what I mean. I forget indeed what it was I said. And so you think
      you'll go up to town tonight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden comprehension of what was slipping away from his grasp aroused
      him. &ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; he urged her, &ldquo;don't forget what it was you said! I
      wish you'd talk more with me about that. It was what I wanted to hear. You
      never tell me what you're really thinking about.&rdquo; She received the
      reproach with a mildly incredulous smile in her eyes. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I know&mdash;who
      was it used to scold me about that? Oh&rdquo;&mdash;she seemed suddenly reminded
      of something&mdash;&ldquo;I was forgetting to mention it. I have a letter from
      Celia Madden. She is back in England; she is coming to us Saturday, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put out his lips a trifle. &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; he objected, &ldquo;but what
      has it got to do with what we were talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking about?&rdquo; she queried, with a momentarily blank countenance. &ldquo;Oh,
      she used to bully me about my deceit, and treachery, and similar crimes.
      But I shall be immensely glad to see her. I always fight with her, but I
      think I like her better than any other woman alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like her too,&rdquo; Thorpe was impelled to say, with a kind of solemnity.
      &ldquo;She reminds me of some of the happiest hours in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife, after a brief glance into his face, laughed pleasantly, if with
      a trace of flippancy. &ldquo;You say nice things,&rdquo; she observed, slightly
      inclining her head. &ldquo;But now that Celia is coming, it would be as well to
      have another man. It's such dreadfully short notice, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay your father could come, all right,&rdquo; Thorpe suggested. &ldquo;I'd
      rather have him than almost anyone else. Would you mind asking him&mdash;or
      shall I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An abrupt silence marked this introduction of a subject upon which the
      couple had differed openly. Thorpe, through processes unaccountable to
      himself, had passed from a vivid dislike of General Kervick to a habit of
      mind in which he thoroughly enjoyed having him about. The General had been
      twice to High Thorpe, and on each occasion had so prolonged his stay that,
      in retrospect, the period of his absence seemed inconsiderable. The master
      now, thinking upon it in this minute of silence, was conscious of having
      missed him greatly. He would not have been bored to the extremity of
      threatening to go to London, if Kervick had been here. The General was a
      gentleman, and yet had the flexible adaptability of a retainer; he had
      been trained in discipline, and hence knew how to defer without becoming
      fulsome or familiar; he was a man of the world and knew an unlimited
      number of racy stories, and even if he repeated some of them unduly, they
      were better than no stories at all. And then, there was his matchless,
      unfailing patience in playing chess or backgammon or draughts or bezique,
      whatever he perceived that the master desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really wish it,&rdquo; Edith said at last, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's what I don't understand,&rdquo; Thorpe urged upon her with some
      vigour. &ldquo;If I like him, I don't see why his own daughter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, need we discuss it?&rdquo; she broke in, impatiently. &ldquo;If I'm an unnatural
      child, why then I am one, and may it not be allowed to pass at that?&rdquo; A
      stormy kind of smile played upon her beautifully-cut lips as she added:
      &ldquo;Surely one's filial emotions are things to be taken for granted&mdash;relieved
      from the necessity of explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe grinned faintly at the hint of pleasantry, but he did not
      relinquish his point. &ldquo;Well&mdash;unless you really veto the thing&mdash;I
      think I'd like to tell him to come,&rdquo; he said, with composed obstinacy.
      Upon an afterthought he added: &ldquo;There's no reason why he shouldn't meet
      the Duke, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No specific reason,&rdquo; she returned, with calm coolness of tone and manner.
      &ldquo;And certainly I do not see myself in the part of Madame Veto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right then&mdash;I'll send him a wire,&rdquo; said Thorpe. His victory made
      him uneasy, yet he saw no way of abandoning it with decorum.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the two, standing in a silence full of tacit constraint, looked
      aimlessly away from the terrace, they saw at the same instant a vehicle
      with a single horse coming rather briskly up the driveway, some hundreds
      of yards below. It was recognizable at once as the local trap from Punsey
      station, and as usual it was driven by a boy from the village. Seated
      beside this lad was a burly, red-bearded man in respectable clothes, who,
      to judge from the tin-box and travelling-bags fastened on behind, seemed
      coming to High Thorpe to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who on earth is that?&rdquo; asked Thorpe, wonderingly. The man was obviously
      of the lower class, yet there seemed something about him which invited
      recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presumably it's the new head-gardener,&rdquo; she replied with brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her accent recalled to Thorpe the fact that there had been something
      disagreeable in their conversation, and the thought of it was unpleasant
      to him. &ldquo;Why, I didn't know you had a new man coming,&rdquo; he said, turning to
      her with an overture of smiling interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, and then, as if weighing the proffered propitiation
      and rejecting it, turned slowly and went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trap apparently ended its course at some back entrance: he did not see
      it again. He strolled indoors, after a little, and told his man to pack a
      bag for London, and order the stanhope to take him to the train.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN the early morning, long before any of the hotel people had made
      themselves heard moving about, Thorpe got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long time since he had liked himself and his surroundings so
      little. The bed seemed all right to the eye, and even to the touch, but he
      had slept very badly in it, none the less. The room was luxuriously
      furnished, as was the entire suite, but it was all strange and
      uncomfortable to his senses. The operation of shaving and dressing in
      solitude produced an oppression of loneliness. He regretted not having
      brought his man with him for this reason, and then, upon meditation, for
      other reasons. A person of his position ought always to have a servant
      with him. The hotel people must have been surprised at his travelling
      unattended&mdash;and the people at High Thorpe must also have thought it
      strange. It flashed across his mind that no doubt his wife had most of all
      thought it strange. How would she explain to herself his sudden,
      precipitate journey to London alone? Might she not quite naturally put an
      unpleasant construction upon it? It was bad enough to have to remember
      that they had parted in something like a tiff; he found it much worse to
      be fancying the suspicions with which she would be turning over his
      mysterious absence in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went downstairs as speedily as possible and, discovering no overt signs
      of breakfast in the vicinity of the restaurant, passed out and made his
      way to the Embankment. This had been a favourite walk of his in the old
      days&mdash;but he considered it now with an unsympathetic eye. It seemed a
      dry and haggard and desolate-looking place by comparison with his former
      impressions of it. The morning was grey-skied, but full of a hard quality
      of light, which brought out to the uncompromising uttermost the
      dilapidated squalor of the Surrey side. The water was low, and from the
      mud and ooze of the ugly opposite shore, or perhaps from the discoloured
      stream itself, there proceeded a smell which offended his unaccustomed
      nostril. A fitful, gusty wind was blowing from the east, and ever and
      again it gathered dust in eddying swoops from the roadway, and flung it in
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on toward the City, without any conscious purpose, and with no
      very definite reflections. It occurred to him that if his wife did impute
      to him some unworthy motive in stealing off to London, and made herself
      unhappy in doing so&mdash;that would at least provide the compensation of
      showing that she cared. The thought, however, upon examination, contained
      very meagre elements of solace. He could not in the least be sure about
      any of the workings of her mind. There might be more or less annoyance
      mixed up this morning with the secret thoughts she had concerning him&mdash;or
      she might not be bothering her head about him at all. This latter
      contingency had never presented itself so frankly to him before. He looked
      hard at it, and saw more semblances of probability about it than he liked.
      It might very well be that she was not thinking about him one way or the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      A depressing consciousness that practically nobody need think about him
      pervaded his soul. Who cared what he said or did or felt? The City had
      forgotten his very existence. In the West End, only here and there some
      person might chance to remember his name as that of some rich bounder who
      had married Lady Cressage. Nowhere else in England, save one dull strip of
      agricultural blankness in a backward home county, was there a human being
      who knew anything whatever about him. And this was his career! It was for
      this that he had planned that memorable campaign, and waged that amazing
      series of fortnightly battles, never missing victory, never failing at any
      point of the complicated strategy, and crowning it all with a culminating
      triumph which had been the wonder and admiration of the whole financial
      world! A few score of menials or interested inferiors bowed to him; he
      drove some good horses, and was attentively waited upon, and had a
      never-failing abundance of good things to eat and drink aud smoke. Hardly
      anything more than that, when you came to think of it&mdash;and the
      passing usufruct of all these things could be enjoyed by any fool who had
      a ten-pound note in his pocket!
    </p>
    <p>
      What gross trick had the fates played on him? He had achieved power&mdash;and
      where was that power? What had he done with it? What COULD he do with it?
      He had an excess of wealth, it was true, but in what way could it command
      an excess of enjoyment? The very phrase was a paradox, as he dimly
      perceived. There existed only a narrow margin of advantage in favour of
      the rich man. He could eat and drink a little more and a little better
      than the poor man; he could have better clothes, and lie abed later in the
      morning, and take life easier all round&mdash;but only within hard and
      fast bounds. There was an ascertained limit beyond which the millionaire
      could no more stuff himself with food and wine than could the beggar. It
      might be pleasant to take an added hour or two in bed in the morning, but
      to lie in bed all day would be an infliction. So it ran indefinitely&mdash;this
      thin selvedge of advantage which money could buy&mdash;with deprivation on
      the one side, and surfeit on the other. Candidly, was it not true that
      more happiness lay in winning the way out of deprivation, than in
      inventing safeguards against satiety? The poor man succeeding in making
      himself rich&mdash;at numerous stages of the operation there might be made
      a moral snap-shot of the truly happy man. But not after he had reached the
      top. Then disintegration began at once. The contrast between what he
      supposed he could do, and what he finds it possible to do, is too vast to
      be accepted with equanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be said that after breakfast&mdash;a meal which he found in an
      Italian restaurant of no great cleanliness or opulence of pretension, and
      ate with an almost novel relish&mdash;Thorpe took somewhat less gloomy
      views of his position. He still walked eastward, wandering into warehouse
      and shipping quarters skirting the river, hitherto quite unknown to him,
      and pursuing in an idle, inconsequent fashion his meditations. He
      established in his mind the proposition that since an excess of enjoyment
      was impossible&mdash;since one could not derive a great block of happiness
      from the satisfaction of the ordinary appetites, but at the most could
      only gather a little from each&mdash;the desirable thing was to multiply
      as much as might be those tastes and whims and fancies which passed for
      appetites, and thus expand the area of possible gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seemed very logical indeed, but it did not apply itself to his
      individual needs with much facility. What did he want to do that he had
      not done? It was difficult for him to say. Perhaps it was chandlers' signs
      and windows about him, and the indefinable seafaring preoccupation
      suggested by the high-walled, narrow streets, which raised the question of
      a yacht in his mind. Did he want a yacht? He could recall having once
      dwelt with great fondness upon such a project: doubtless it would still be
      full of attractions for him. He liked the water, and the water liked him&mdash;and
      he was better able now than formerly to understand how luxurious existence
      can be made in modern private ships. He decided that he would have a yacht&mdash;and
      then perceived that the decision brought no exhilaration. He was no
      happier than before. He could decide that he would have anything he chose
      to name&mdash;and it would in no whit lighten his mood. The yacht might be
      as grand as High Thorpe, and relatively as spacious and well ordered, but
      would he not grow as tired of the one as he had of the other?
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short at this blunt self-expression of something he had never
      admitted to himself. Was he indeed tired of High Thorpe? He had assured
      his wife to the contrary yesterday. He reiterated the assurance to his own
      mind now. It was instead that he was tired of himself. He carried a
      weariness about with him, which looked at everything with apathetic eyes,
      and cared for nothing. Some nameless paralysis had settled upon his
      capacity for amusement and enjoyment, and atrophied it. He had had the
      power to expand his life to the farthest boundaries of rich experience and
      sensation, and he had deliberately shrunk into a sort of herbaceous
      nonentity, whom nobody knew or cared about. He might have had London at
      his beck and call, and yet of all that the metropolis might mean to a
      millionaire, he had been able to think of nothing better than that it
      should send old Kervick to him, to help beguile his boredom with dominoes
      and mess-room stories! Pah! He was disgusted with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Striking out a new course, with the Monument as his guide, he presently
      came into a part of the City which had a certain familiarity for him. He
      walked up St. Swithin's Lane, looking at the strange forms of foreign
      fruit exposed at the shop-doors, and finding in them some fleeting
      recurrence of the hint that travel was what he needed. Then he stopped, to
      look through the railings and open gateway at an enclosure on the left,
      and the substantial, heavily-respectable group of early Victorian
      buildings beyond. Some well-dressed men were standing talking in one of
      the porches. The stiff yellowish-stucco pilasters of this entrance, and
      the tall uniformed figure of the porter in the shadow, came into the
      picture as he observed it; they gave forth a suggestion of satisfied
      smugness&mdash;of orderly but altogether unillumined routine. Nothing
      could be more commonplace to the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet to his imagination, eighteen months before, what mysterious marvels of
      power had lurked hidden behind those conventional portals! Within those
      doors, in some inner chamber, sat men whose task it was to direct the
      movements of the greatest force the world had ever known. They and their
      cousins in Paris and Frankfort, or wherever they lived, between them
      wielded a vaster authority than all the Parliaments of the earth. They
      could change a government, or crush the aspirations of a whole people, or
      decide a question of peace or war, by the silent dictum of their little
      family council. He remembered now how he had stood on this same spot, and
      stared with fascinated gaze at this quadrangle of dull houses, and
      pondered upon what it must feel like to be a Rothschild&mdash;and that was
      only a little over a year ago!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sense of fascination whatever in his present gaze. He found
      himself regarding instead, with a kind of detached curiosity, the little
      knot of men in frock-coats and silk-hats who stood talking in the doorway.
      It was barely ten o'clock, yet clearly business was proceeding within. One
      of these persons whom he beheld might be a Rothschild, for aught he knew;
      at any rate, it was presumable that some of them were on the premises. He
      had heard it said that the very head of the house listened to quotations
      from the tape while he ate his luncheon, and interrupted his conversations
      with the most important of non-commercial callers, to make or refuse
      bargains in shares offered by brokers who came in. What impulse lay behind
      this extraordinary devotion to labour? Toward what conceivable goal could
      it be striving?
    </p>
    <p>
      To work hard and risk great things for the possession of a fortune, in
      order to enjoy it afterward&mdash;he could understand how that attracted
      men. But to possess already the biggest of human fortunes, and still work&mdash;that
      baffled him. He wished he knew some of those men in there, especially if
      they belonged to the place. It would be wonderfully interesting to get at
      the inner point of view of New Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later, in Colin Semple's office, he sat down to await the coming
      of that gentleman. &ldquo;Then he doesn't get here so early nowadays?&rdquo; he
      suggested to the head-clerk who, with instant recognition and exaggerated
      deference, had ushered him into this furthermost private room. It pleased
      him to assume that prosperity had relaxed the Scotchman's vigilance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, sir,&rdquo; the clerk replied. &ldquo;A bit earlier if anything, as a rule.
      But I think he is stopping at his solicitors on his way to the City. I
      hope you are very well, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I'm very fit&mdash;thanks,&rdquo; Thorpe said, listlessly, and the
      other left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Semple, when at last he arrived, bustled into the room with unaffected
      gratification at the news he had heard without. &ldquo;Well, well, Thorpe man!&rdquo;
       he cried, and shook hands cordially. &ldquo;This is fine! If I'd only known you
      were in town! Why wouldn't you have told me you were coming? I'd never
      have kept you waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe laughed wearily. &ldquo;I hardly knew I was in town myself. I only ran up
      last night. I thought it would amuse me to have a look round&mdash;but
      things seem as dull as ditchwater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Semple, &ldquo;the autumn is opening verra well indeed. There are
      more new companies, and a better public subscription all round, than for
      any first week of October I remember. Westralians appear bad on the face
      of things, it's true&mdash;but don't believe all you hear of them. There's
      more than the suspicion of a 'rig' there. Besides, you haven't a penny in
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't thinking of that,&rdquo; Thorpe told him, with comprehensive
      vagueness. &ldquo;Well, I suppose you're still coining money,&rdquo; he observed,
      after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keeping along&mdash;keeping along,&rdquo; the broker replied, cheerfully. &ldquo;I
      canna complain.&rdquo; Thorpe looked at him with a meditative frown. &ldquo;Well, what
      are you going to do with it, after you've got it?&rdquo; he demanded, almost
      with sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scotchman, after a surprised instant, smiled. &ldquo;Oh, I'll just keep my
      hands on it,&rdquo; he assured him, lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't what I mean,&rdquo; Thorpe said, groping after what he did mean,
      with sullen tenacity, among his thoughts. His large, heavy face exhibited
      a depressed gravity which attracted the other's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; Semple asked quickly. &ldquo;Has anything gone wrong with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe slowly shook his head. &ldquo;What better off do you think you'll be with
      six figures than you are with five?&rdquo; he pursued, with dogmatic insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Semple shrugged his shoulders. He seemed to have grown much brighter and
      gayer of mood in this past twelvemonth. Apparently he was somewhat
      stouter, and certainly there was a mellowed softening of his sharp glance
      and shrewd smile. It was evident that his friend's mood somewhat
      nonplussed him, but his good-humour was unflagging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the way we're taught at school,&rdquo; he hazarded, genially. &ldquo;In all the
      arithmetics six beats five, and seven beats six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're wrong,&rdquo; Thorpe declared, and then consented to laugh in a
      grudging, dogged way at his friend's facial confession of puzzlement.
      &ldquo;What I mean is&mdash;what's the good of piling up money, while you can't
      pile up the enjoyments it will buy? What will a million give you, that the
      fifth of it, or the tenth of it, won't give you just as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Semple, with a gleam of comprehension in his glance. &ldquo;So
      you've come to that frame of mind, have you? Why does a man go on and
      shoot five hundred pheasants, when he can eat only one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you like the mere making of money, I've nothing more to say,&rdquo;
       Thorpe responded, with a touch of resentment. &ldquo;I've always thought of you
      as a man like myself, who wanted to make his pile and then enjoy himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Scotchman laughed joyously. &ldquo;Enjoy myself! Like you!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Man,
      you're as doleful as a mute at a laird's funeral! What's come over you? I
      know what it is. You go and take a course of German waters&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that be damned!&rdquo; Thorpe objected, gloomily. &ldquo;I tell you I'm all
      right. Only&mdash;only&mdash;God! I've a great notion to go and get
      drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colin Semple viewed his companion with a more sympathetic expression. &ldquo;I'm
      sorry you're so hipped,&rdquo; he said, in gentle tones. &ldquo;It can't be more than
      some passing whimsy. You're in no real trouble, are you?&mdash;no family
      trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe shook his head. &ldquo;The whole thing is rot!&rdquo; he affirmed,
      enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What whole thing?&rdquo; The broker perched on the edge of his desk, and with
      patient philosophy took him up. &ldquo;Do you mean eighty thousand a year is
      rot? That depends upon the man who has it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that well enough,&rdquo; broke in the other, heavily. &ldquo;That's what I'm
      kicking about. I'm no good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Semple, looking attentively down upon him, pursed his lips in reflection.
      &ldquo;That's not the case,&rdquo; he observed with argumentative calmness. &ldquo;You're a
      great deal of good. I'm not so sure that what you've been trying to do is
      any good, though. Come!&mdash;I read you like large print. You've set out
      to live the life of a rich country squire&mdash;and it hasn't come off. It
      couldn't come off! I never believed it would. You haven't the taste for it
      inbred in your bones. You haven't the thousand little habits and interests
      that they take in with their mother's milk, and that make such a life
      possible. When you look at a hedge, you don't think of it as something to
      worry live animals out of. When you see one of your labourers, you don't
      care who his father was, or which dairymaid his uncle ought to have
      married, if he had wanted to get a certain cottage. You don't want to know
      the name of everybody whose roof you can see; much less could you remember
      them, and talk about them, and listen to gossip about them, year after
      year. It isn't a passion in your blood to ride to hounds, and to shoot,
      and all that. It doesn't come to you by tradition&mdash;and you haven't
      the vacancy of mind which might be a substitute for tradition. What are
      you doing in the country, then? Just eating too much, and sitting about,
      and getting fat and stupid. If you want the truth, there it is for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe, putting out his lips judicially, inclined upon reflection to the
      view that this was the truth. &ldquo;That's all right, as far as it goes,&rdquo; he
      assented, with hesitation. &ldquo;But what the hell else is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little Scotchman had grown too interested in his diagnosis to drop it
      in an incomplete state. &ldquo;A year ago,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you had won your
      victories like a veritable Napoleon. You had everything in your own hands;
      Napoleon himself was not more the master of what he saw about him than you
      were. And then what did you do? You voluntarily retired yourself to your
      Elba. It wasn't that you were beaten and driven there by others; you went
      of your own accord. Have you ever thought, Thorpe, of this? Napoleon was
      the greatest man of his age&mdash;one of the greatest men of all ages&mdash;not
      only in war but in a hundred other ways. He spent the last six years of
      his life at St. Helena&mdash;in excellent health and with companions that
      he talked freely to&mdash;and in all the extraordinarily copious reports
      of his conversations there, we don't get a single sentence worth
      repeating. If you read it, you'll see he talked like a dull, ordinary
      body. The greatness had entirely evaporated from him, the moment he was
      put on an island where he had nothing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes-s,&rdquo; said Thorpe, thoughtfully. He accepted the application without
      any qualms about the splendour of the comparison it rested upon. He had
      done the great things, just as Semple said, and there was no room for
      false modesty about them in his mind. &ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that I
      did what I had always thought I wanted to do most. I was quite certain in
      my mind that that was what I wanted. And if we say now that I was wrong&mdash;if
      we admit that that wasn't what I really wanted&mdash;why then, God knows
      what it is I DO want. I'll be hanged if I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back to the City,&rdquo; Semple told him. &ldquo;That's where you belong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no!&rdquo; Thorpe spoke with emphasis. &ldquo;That's where you're all off. I
      don't belong in the City at all. I hate the whole outfit. What the devil
      amusement would it be to me to take other men's money away from them? I'd
      be wanting all the while to give it back to them. And certainly I wouldn't
      get any fun out of their taking my money away from me. Besides, it doesn't
      entertain me. I've no taste at all for it. I never look at a financial
      paper now. I could no more interest myself in all that stuff again than I
      could fly. That's the hell of it&mdash;to be interested in anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in for politics,&rdquo; the other suggested, with less warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Thorpe commented, with a lingering tone. &ldquo;Perhaps I ought
      to think more about that. By the way, what's Plowden doing? I've lost all
      track of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abroad somewhere, I fancy,&rdquo; Semple replied. His manner exhibited a
      profound indifference. &ldquo;When his mother died he came into something&mdash;I
      don't know how much. I don't think I've seen him since&mdash;and that must
      have been six months and more ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I heard about it at the time,&rdquo; the other said. &ldquo;It must be about
      that. His sister and brother&mdash;the young Plowdens&mdash;they're coming
      to us at the end of the week, I believe. You didn't hit it off
      particularly with Plowden, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Semple emitted a contemptuous little laugh. &ldquo;I did not quarrel with him&mdash;if
      you mean that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but even to please you, Thorpe, I couldn't bring
      myself to put my back into the job of making money for him. He was treated
      fairly&mdash;even generously, d'ye mind. I should think, all told, he had
      some thirty thousand pounds for his shares, and that's a hundred times as
      much as I had a pleasure in seeing him get. Each man can wear his own
      parasites, but it's a task for him to stand another man's. I shook your
      Lord Plowden off, when the chance came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THAT'S all right,&rdquo; Thorpe assured him, easily. &ldquo;I never told you that he
      was any good. I merely felt like giving him a leg up&mdash;because really
      at the start he was of use to me. I did owe him something....It was at his
      house that I met my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Semple, with dispassionate brevity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEN he had parted with Semple, at a corner where the busy broker, who had
      walked out with him, obviously fidgeted to get away, Thorpe could think of
      no one else in the City whom he desired to see. A call upon his bankers
      would, he knew, be made an occasion of extremely pleasant courtesy by
      those affable people, but upon reflection it seemed scarcely worth the
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in a mood for indolent sauntering, and he made the long stretch of
      the Holborn thoroughfare in a leisurely fashion, turning off when the whim
      seized him into odd courts and alley-ways to see what they were like.
      After luncheon, he continued his ramble, passing at last from St. Giles,
      through avenues which had not existed in the London of his boyhood, to the
      neighbourhood of the Dials. Here also the landmarks seemed all changed,
      but there was still enough ostentatious squalor and disorder to identify
      the district. He observed it and its inhabitants with a certain new
      curiosity. A notable alteration for the better had come over his spirits.
      It might be the champagne at luncheon, or it might be the mere operation
      of a frank talk with Semple, that had dissipated his gloom. At all events
      it was gone&mdash;and he strolled along in quite placid contentment,
      taking in the panorama of London's more intimate life with the interest of
      a Londoner who has obtained a fresh country eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He who had seen most of the world, and not cared much about the spectacle,
      found himself now consciously enjoying observation as he had not supposed
      it possible to do. He surrendered himself to the experience with a novel
      sense of having found something worth while&mdash;and found it, moreover,
      under his very nose. In some dull, meaningless fashion he had always known
      this part of London, and been familiar with its external aspects. Now
      suddenly he perceived that the power had come to him of seeing it all in a
      different way. The objects he beheld, inanimate and otherwise, had
      specific new meanings for him. His mind was stirred pleasurably by the
      things they said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at all the contents of the windows as he passed; at the barrows
      of the costers and hawkers crowding up the side-streets; at the
      coarse-haired, bare-headed girls and women standing about in their shawls
      and big white aprons; at the weakling babies in their arms or about the
      thick, clumsy folds of their stained skirts; at the grimy, shuffling
      figures of their men-folk, against the accustomed background of the
      public-house corner, with its half-open door, and its fly-blown
      theatre-bills in the windows; at the drivers of the vans and carts,
      sleepily overlooking the huge horses, gigantic to the near view as some
      survival from the age of mammoths, which pushed gingerly, ploddingly,
      their tufted feet over the greasy stones; at foul interiors where through
      the blackness one discerned bent old hags picking over refuse; at the
      faces which, as he passed, made some special human appeal to him&mdash;faces
      blurred with drink, faces pallid with under-feeding, faces worn into masks
      by the tension of trouble, faces sweetened by resignation, faces aglow
      with devil-may-care glee...he looked, as it were, into the pulsing heart
      of something which had scarcely seemed alive to him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, he found himself halting at the door of his sister's
      book-shop. A new boy stood guard over the stock exposed on the shelf and
      stands outside, and he looked stonily at the great man; it was evident
      that he was as far from suspecting his greatness as his relationship. It
      pleased Thorpe for a little to take up one book after another, and pretend
      to read from it, and force the boy to watch him hard. He had almost the
      temptation to covertly slip a volume into his pocket, and see what the lad
      would do. It was remarkable, he reflected with satisfaction&mdash;this new
      capacity within him to find drama in trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      There floated into his mind the recollection of some absurd squabble he
      had had with his sister about the sign overhead. He stepped back a few
      paces and looked up at it. There were the old words&mdash;&ldquo;Thorpe,
      Bookseller&rdquo;&mdash;right enough, but they seemed to stand forth with a
      novel prominence. Upon a second glance, he saw that the board had been
      repainted. At this he laughed aloud. The details of the episode came back
      to him now. For some reason, or no reason at all&mdash;he could not now
      imagine what on earth could have prompted him&mdash;he had last spring
      caused his sister to be informed of his wish that her own name, Dabney,
      should be substituted for that of Thorpe on her sign. It was to Julia that
      he had confided this mission, and it was Julia who, in a round-about way,
      had disclosed to him presently her mother's deep resolution to do nothing
      of the sort. He laughed again at the added defiance that this refurbishing
      of the old sign expressed, and still was grinning broadly as he entered
      the shop and pushed his way along to the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood beside her desk as she seemed to have stood ever since he could
      remember her&mdash;tall, placid, dull-eyed, self-sufficient, exhaling as
      it were a kind of stubborn yet competent listlessness. Her long, mannish
      countenance expressed an undoubted interest in his presence, when she
      recognized him, but he had no clear perception whether it was pleased or
      otherwise. In their infrequent latter-day encounters he had dropped the
      habit of kissing her, and there was certainly no hint in her manner of
      expecting, much less inviting, its renewal now&mdash;but upon a sudden
      impulse he drew her to him with an arm flung round her gaunt waist,
      smacked his lips with effusion upon her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her surprise, as she withdrew herself somewhat forcefully from his
      embrace, was plain enough. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she exclaimed vaguely, and then looked
      at him. &ldquo;You're getting fatter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No I'm not,&rdquo; he rejoined, with the earnestness belonging to an important
      topic. &ldquo;People think I am&mdash;but it's merely the looseness of these
      clothes. There's really no difference since I was here last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The glance they exchanged was so full of the tacit comment that this last
      visit was a long time ago, that Thorpe put it into words. &ldquo;Let's see&mdash;that
      was just before Christmas, wasn't it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;You were going to get married in a
      week or two, I remember, and THAT was in January, wasn't it? I was taking
      stock, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded in turn. The thought that his only sister recalled his marriage
      merely as a date, like a royal anniversary or a bank-holiday, and held
      herself implacably aloof from all contact with his domestic life, annoyed
      him afresh. &ldquo;You're an awful goat, not to come near us,&rdquo; he felt impelled,
      in brotherly frankness, to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put out her lips, and wagged her head a little, in a gesture which it
      flashed across him his own mirror might often have recorded. &ldquo;I thought
      that was all settled and done with long ago,&rdquo; she said, moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I won't worry you with it, Lou,&rdquo; he observed, with reassuring
      kindness of tone. &ldquo;I never felt so much like being nice to you in my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed surprised at this, too, and regarded him with a heavy new
      fixity of gaze. No verbal comment, apparently, occurred to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia and Alfred all right?&rdquo; he queried, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; she made brief answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they write to you, don't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SHE does&mdash;sometimes. They seem to be doing themselves very well,
      from what she says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'd write oftener, if you'd answer her letters,&rdquo; he told her, in tones
      of confidential reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't write letters unless I've got something to say,&rdquo; she
      answered, as if the explanation were ample.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people were domiciled for the time being at Dusseldorf, where
      Alfred had thought he would most like to begin his Continental
      student-career, and where Julia, upon the more or less colourable pretext
      of learning the language, might enjoy the mingled freedom and occupation
      of a home of her own. They had taken a house for the summer and autumn,
      and would do the same in Dresden or Munich, later on, for the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I would really have liked,&rdquo; Thorpe confided to his sister now, &ldquo;was
      to have had them both live with me. They would have been as welcome as the
      day is long. I could see, of course, in Alfred's case, that if he's set on
      being an artist, he ought to study abroad. Even the best English artists,
      he says, do that at the beginning. So it was all right for him to go. But
      Julia&mdash;it was different with her&mdash;I was rather keen about her
      staying. My wife was just as keen as I was. She took the greatest fancy to
      Julia from the very start&mdash;and so far as I could see, Julia liked her
      all right. In fact, I thought Julia would want to stay&mdash;but somehow
      she didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She always spoke very highly of your wife,&rdquo; Mrs. Dabney affirmed with
      judicial fairness. &ldquo;I think she does like her very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then what did she want to hyke off to live among those Dutchmen for,
      when one of the best houses in England was open to her?&rdquo; Thorpe demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't ask me,&rdquo; her mother responded. Her tone seemed to carry the
      suggestion that by silence she could best protect her daughter's
      interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe you know any more about it than I do,&rdquo; was his impulsive
      comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay not,&rdquo; she replied, with indifference. &ldquo;Probably she didn't
      fancy living in so big a house&mdash;although heaven knows her ideas are
      big enough about most things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she say so?&rdquo; Thorpe asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow shook her head with dispassionate candour. &ldquo;She didn't say
      anything to me about it, one way or the other. I formed my own impressions&mdash;that's
      all. It's a free country. Everybody can form their impressions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you'd tell me what you really think,&rdquo; Thorpe urged her, mildly
      persuasive. &ldquo;You know how fond I am of Julia, and how little I want to do
      her an injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she wouldn't feel THAT way,&rdquo; Louisa observed, vaguely. &ldquo;If you ask me
      plain, I think it was dull for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Thorpe, upon reflection, &ldquo;I shouldn't be surprised if it was.
      I hadn't thought of that. But still&mdash;why she and my wife could be
      company for each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk as if life was merely a long railway journey,&rdquo; she told him, in
      an unexpected flight of metaphor. &ldquo;Two women cooped up in a lonesome
      country house may be a little less lonely than one of them by herself
      would be&mdash;but not much. It's none of my business&mdash;but how your
      wife must hate it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed easily. &ldquo;Ah, that's where you're wrong,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She doesn't
      care about anything but gardening. That's her hobby. She's crazy about it.
      We've laid out more in new greenhouses alone, not counting the plants,
      than would rebuild this building. I'm not sure the heating apparatus
      wouldn't come to that, alone. And then the plants! What do you think of
      six and eight guineas for a single root? Those are the amaryllises&mdash;and
      if you come to orchids, you can pay hundreds if you like. Well, that's her
      passion. That's what she really loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what she seizes upon to keep her from just dying of loneliness,&rdquo;
       Louisa retorted, obstinately, and at a sign of dissent from her brother
      she went on. &ldquo;Oh, I know what I'm talking about. I have three or four
      customers&mdash;ladies in the country, and one of them is a lady of title,
      too&mdash;and they order gardening books and other books through me, and
      when they get up to town, once a year or so, they come here and they talk
      to me about it. And there isn't one of them that at the bottom of her
      heart doesn't hate it. They'd rather dodge busses at Charing Cross corner
      all day long, than raise flowers as big as cheeses, if they had their own
      way. But they don't have their own way, and they must have something to
      occupy themselves with&mdash;and they take to gardening. I daresay I'd
      even do it myself if I had to live in the country, which thank God I
      don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's because you don't know anything about the country,&rdquo; he told her,
      but the retort, even while it justified itself, had a hollow sound in his
      own ears. &ldquo;All you know outside of London is Margate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to Yarmouth and Lowestoft this summer,&rdquo; she informed him,
      crushingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow he lacked the heart to laugh. &ldquo;I know what you mean, Lou,&rdquo; he
      said, with an affectionate attempt at placation. &ldquo;I suppose there's a good
      deal in what you say. It is dull, out there at my place, if you have too
      much of it. Perhaps that's a good hint about my wife. It never occurred to
      me, but it may be so. But the deuce of it is, what else is there to do? We
      tried a house in London, during the Season&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw in the papers you were here,&rdquo; she said impassively, in comment
      upon his embarrassed pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't look you up, because I didn't think you wanted much to see me&rdquo;&mdash;he
      explained with a certain awkwardness&mdash;&ldquo;but bye-gones are all
      bye-gones. We took a town house, but we didn't like it. It was one endless
      procession of stupid and tiresome calls and dinners and parties; we got
      awfully sick of it, and swore we wouldn't try it again. Well there you
      are, don't you see? It's stupid in Hertfordshire, and it's stupid here. Of
      course one can travel abroad, but that's no good for more than a few
      months. Of course it would be different if I had something to do. I tell
      you God's truth, Lou&mdash;sometimes I feel as if I was really happier
      when I was a poor man. I know it's all rot&mdash;I really wasn't&mdash;but
      sometimes it SEEMS as if I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She contemplated him with a leaden kind of gaze. &ldquo;Didn't it ever occur to
      you to do some good with your money?&rdquo; she said, with slow bluntness. Then,
      as if fearing a possible misconception, she added more rapidly: &ldquo;I don't
      mean among your own family. We're a clannish people, we Thorpes; we'd
      always help our own flesh and blood, even if we kicked them while we were
      doing it&mdash;but I mean outside, in the world at large.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I got to do with the world at large? I didn't make it; I'm not
      responsible for it.&rdquo; He muttered the phrases lightly enough, but a certain
      fatuity in them seemed to attract his attention when he heard their sound.
      &ldquo;I've given between five and six thousand pounds to London hospitals
      within the present year,&rdquo; he added, straightening himself. &ldquo;I wonder you
      didn't see it. It was in all the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hospitals!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to exaggerate the scorn which her voice imported into
      the word. He looked at her with unfeigned surprise, and then took in the
      impression that she was upon a subject which exceptionally interested her.
      Certainly the display of something approaching animation in her glance and
      manner was abnormal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said 'do some GOOD with your money,'&rdquo; she reminded him, still with a
      vibration of feeling in her tone. &ldquo;You must live in the country, if you
      think London hospitals are deserving objects. They couldn't fool Londoners
      on that point, not if they had got the Prince to go on his hands and
      knees. And you give a few big cheques to them,&rdquo; she went on, meditatively,
      &ldquo;and you never ask how they're managed, or what rings are running them for
      their own benefit, or how your money is spent&mdash;and you think you've
      done a noble, philanthropic thing! Oh no&mdash;I wasn't talking about
      humbug charity. I was talking about doing some genuine good in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his leg over the high stool, and pushed his hat back with a smile.
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, genially. &ldquo;What do you propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't propose anything,&rdquo; she told him, after a moment's hesitation.
      &ldquo;You must work that out for yourself. What might seem important to me
      might not interest you at all&mdash;and if you weren't interested you
      wouldn't do anything. But this I do say to you, Joel&mdash;and I've said
      it to myself every day for this last year or more, and had you in mind all
      the time, too&mdash;if I had made a great fortune, and I sat about in
      purple and fine linen doing nothing but amuse myself in idleness and
      selfishness, letting my riches accumulate and multiply themselves without
      being of use to anybody, I should be ASHAMED to look my fellow-creatures
      in the face! You were born here. You know what London slums are like. You
      know what Clare Market was like&mdash;it's bad enough still&mdash;and what
      the Seven Dials and Drury Lane and a dozen other places round here are
      like to this day. That's only within a stone's throw. Have you seen
      Charles Booth's figures about the London poor? Of course you haven't&mdash;and
      it doesn't matter. You KNOW what they are like. But you don't care. The
      misery and ignorance and filth and hopelessness of two or three hundred
      thousand people doesn't interest you. You sit upon your money-bags and
      smile. If you want the truth, I'm ashamed to have you for a brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm damned!&rdquo; was Thorpe's delayed and puzzled comment upon this
      outburst. He looked long at his sister, in blank astonishment. &ldquo;Since when
      have you been taken this way?&rdquo; he asked at last, mechanically jocular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; she declared with defensive inconsequence. &ldquo;It's the
      way I feel. It's the way I've felt from the beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was plainly surprised out of his equanimity by this unlooked-for
      demonstration on his sister's part. He got off the stool and walked about
      in the little cleared space round the desk. When he spoke, it was to utter
      something which he could trace to no mental process of which he had been
      conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that that isn't what I've felt too&mdash;from the
      beginning?&rdquo; he demanded of her, almost with truculence. &ldquo;You say I sit on
      my money-bags and smile&mdash;you abuse me with doing no good with my
      money&mdash;how do you know I haven't been studying the subject all this
      while, and making my plans, and getting ready to act? You never did
      believe in me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sniffed at him. &ldquo;I don't believe in you now, at all events,&rdquo; she said,
      bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He assumed the expression of a misunderstood man. &ldquo;Why, this very day&rdquo;&mdash;he
      began, and again was aware that thoughts were coming up, ready-shaped to
      his tongue, which were quite strangers to his brain&mdash;&ldquo;this whole day
      I've been going inch by inch over the very ground you mention; I've been
      on foot since morning, seeing all the corners and alleys of that whole
      district for myself, watching the people and the things they buy and the
      way they live&mdash;and thinking out my plans for doing something. I don't
      claim any credit for it. It seems to me no more than what a man in my
      position ought to do. But I own that to come in, actually tired out from a
      tramp like that, and get blown-up by one's own sister for selfishness and
      heartlessness and miserliness and all the rest of it&mdash;I must say,
      that's a bit rum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louisa did not wince under this reproach as she might have been expected
      to do, nor was there any perceptible amelioration in the heavy frown with
      which she continued to regard him. But her words, uttered after some
      consideration, came in a tone of voice which revealed a desire to avoid
      offense. &ldquo;It won't matter to you, your getting blown-up by me, if you're
      really occupying your mind with that sort of thing. You're too used to it
      for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have liked a less cautious acceptance of his assurances than this&mdash;but
      after all, one did not look to Louisa for enthusiasms. The depth of
      feeling she had disclosed on this subject of London's poor still
      astonished him, but principally now because of its unlikely source. If she
      had been notoriously of an altruistic and free-handed disposition, he
      could have understood it. But she had been always the hard, dry,
      unemotional one; by comparison with her, he felt himself to be a volatile
      and even sentimental person. If she had such views as these, it became
      clear to him that his own views were even much advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a tremendous subject,&rdquo; he said, with loose largeness of manner.
      &ldquo;Only a man who works hard at it can realize how complicated it is. The
      only way is to start with the understanding that something is going to be
      done. No matter how many difficulties there are in the way, SOMETHING'S
      GOING TO BE DONE! If a strong man starts out with that, why then he can
      fight his way through, and push the difficulties aside or bend them to
      suit his purpose, and accomplish something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dabney, listening to this, found nothing in it to quarrel with&mdash;yet
      somehow remained, if not skeptical, then passively unconvinced. &ldquo;What are
      your plans?&rdquo; she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's too soon to formulate anything,&rdquo; he told her, with prepared
      readiness. &ldquo;It isn't a thing to rush into in a hurry, with half baked
      theories and limited information. Great results, permanent results, are
      never obtained that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it isn't any Peabody model-dwelling thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing like it in the least,&rdquo; he assured her, and made a mental note
      to find out what it was she had referred to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord-Rowton houses are better, they say,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;but it seems
      to me that the real thing is that there shouldn't be all this immense
      number of people with only fourpence or fivepence in their pocket. That's
      where the real mischief lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded comprehendingly, but hesitated over further words. Then
      something occurred to him. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you're as keen about
      all this, are you game to give up this footling old shop, and devote your
      time to carrying out my plans, when I've licked 'em into shape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began shaking her head, but then something seemed also to occur to
      her. &ldquo;It'll be time enough to settle that when we get to it, won't it?&rdquo;
       she observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;you've got to promise me now,&rdquo; he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well that I won't!&rdquo; she answered, roundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd see the whole&mdash;the whole scheme come to nothing, would you?&rdquo;&mdash;he
      scolded at her&mdash;&ldquo;rather than abate a jot of your confounded
      mulishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; she commented, with a certain alertness of perception shining
      through the stolidity of her mien. &ldquo;I knew you were humbugging! If you'd
      meant what you said, you wouldn't talk about its coming to nothing because
      I won't do this or that. I ought to have known better. I'm always a goose
      when I believe what you tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A certain abstract justice in her reproach impressed him. &ldquo;No you're not,
      Lou,&rdquo; he replied, coaxingly. &ldquo;I really mean it all&mdash;every word of it&mdash;and
      more. It only occurred to me that it would all go better, if you helped.
      Can't you understand how I should feel that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed in a grudging way to accept anew his professions of sincerity,
      but she resisted all attempts to extract any promise. &ldquo;I don't believe in
      crossing a bridge till I get to it,&rdquo; she declared, when, on the point of
      his departure, he last raised the question, and it had to be left at that.
      He took with him some small books she had tied in a parcel, and told him
      to read. She had spoken so confidently of their illuminating value, that
      he found himself quite committed to their perusal&mdash;and almost to
      their endorsement. He had thought during the day of running down to
      Newmarket, for the Cesarewitch was to be run on the morrow, and someone
      had told him that that was worth seeing. By the time he reached his hotel,
      however, an entirely new project had possessed his mind. He packed his
      bag, and took the next train for home.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I DIDN'T ask your father, after all,&rdquo; was one of the things that Thorpe
      said to his wife next day. He had the manner of one announcing a
      concession, albeit in an affable spirit, and she received the remark with
      a scant, silent nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later he recurred to the subject. They were again upon the
      terrace, where he had been lounging in an easy-chair most of the day, with
      the books his sister had bid him read on a table beside him. He had
      glanced through some of them in a desultory fashion, cutting pages at
      random here and there, but for the most part he had looked straight before
      him at the broad landscape, mellowing now into soft browns and yellows
      under the mild, vague October sun. He had not thought much of the books,
      but he had a certain new sense of enjoyment in the fruits of this placid,
      abstracted rumination which perhaps they had helped to induce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About your father,&rdquo; he said now, as his wife, who had come out to speak
      with him on some other matter, was turning to go away again: &ldquo;I'm afraid I
      annoyed you the other day by what I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no recollection of it,&rdquo; she told him, with tranquil politeness,
      over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself all at once keenly desirous of a conversation on this
      topic. &ldquo;But I want you to recollect,&rdquo; he said, as he rose to his feet.
      There was a suggestion of urgency in his tone which arrested her
      attention. She moved slowly toward the chair, and after a little perched
      herself upon one of its big arms, and looked up at him where he leant
      against the parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've thought of it a good deal,&rdquo; he went on, in halting explanation. His
      purpose seemed clearer to him than were the right phrases in which to
      define it. &ldquo;I persisted in saying that I'd do something you didn't want me
      to do&mdash;something that was a good deal more your affair than mine&mdash;and
      I've blamed myself for it. That isn't at all what I want to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face as well as her silence showed her to be at a loss for an
      appropriate comment. She was plainly surprised, and seemingly embarrassed
      as well. &ldquo;I'm sure you always wish to be nice,&rdquo; she said at last. The
      words and tone were alike gracious, but he detected in them somewhere a
      perfunctory note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;nice!&rdquo; he echoed, in a sudden stress of impatience with the
      word. &ldquo;Damn being 'nice'! Anybody can be 'nice.' I'm thinking of something
      ten thousand times bigger than being 'nice.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I withdraw the word immediately&mdash;unreservedly,&rdquo; she put in, with a
      smile in which he read that genial mockery he knew so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You laugh at me&mdash;whenever I try to talk seriously,&rdquo; he objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laugh?&rdquo; she queried, with an upward glance of demurely simulated
      amazement. &ldquo;Impossible! I assure you I've forgotten how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now we get to it!&rdquo; he broke out, with energy. &ldquo;You're really feeling
      about it just as I am. You're not satisfied with what we're doing&mdash;with
      the life we're leading&mdash;any more than I am. I see that, plain enough,
      now. I didn't dream of it before. Somehow I got the idea that you were
      enjoying it immensely&mdash;the greenhouses and gardens and all that sort
      of thing. And do you know who it was that put me right&mdash;that told me
      you hated it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't let us talk of him!&rdquo; Edith exclaimed, swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe laughed. &ldquo;You're wrong. It wasn't your father. I didn't see him. No&mdash;it
      was my sister. She's never seen you, but all the same she knew enough to
      give me points. She told me I was a fool to suppose you were happy here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How clever of her!&rdquo; A certain bantering smile accompanied the words, but
      on the instant it faded away. She went on with a musing gravity. &ldquo;I'm
      sorry I don't get to know your sister. She seems an extremely real sort of
      person. I can understand that she might be difficult to live with&mdash;I
      daresay all genuine characters are&mdash;but she's very real. Although,
      apparently, conversation isn't her strong point, still I enjoy talking
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; Thorpe asked, knitting his brows in puzzlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I often go to her shop&mdash;or did when I was in town. I went almost
      immediately after our&mdash;our return to England. I was half afraid she
      would recognize me&mdash;the portraits in the papers, you know&mdash;but
      apparently she didn't. And it's splendid&mdash;the way she says absolutely
      nothing more than it's necessary to say. And her candour! If she thinks
      books are bad she says so. Fancy that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still frowned uneasily as he looked down at her. &ldquo;You never mentioned
      to me that you had gone there,&rdquo; he told her, as if in reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it was complicated,&rdquo; Edith explained. &ldquo;She objects to knowing me&mdash;I
      think secretly I respect her a great deal for that&mdash;and therefore
      there is something clandestine about my getting to know her&mdash;and I
      could not be sure how it would impress you, and really it seemed simplest
      not to mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't that alone,&rdquo; he declared, grave-faced still, but with a softer
      voice. &ldquo;Do you remember what I said the other day? It would make all the
      difference in the world to me, if&mdash;if you were really&mdash;actually
      my other half!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The phrase which he had caught at seemed, as it fell upon the air, to
      impregnate it with some benumbing quality. The husband and wife looked
      dumbly, almost vacantly at one another, for what appeared a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean&rdquo;&mdash;all at once Thorpe found tongue, and even a sort of fluency
      as he progressed&mdash;&ldquo;I mean, if you shared things really with me! Oh,
      I'm not complaining; you mustn't think that. The agreement we made at the
      start&mdash;you've kept your part of it perfectly. You've done better than
      that: you've kept still about the fact that it made you unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she interposed, gently. &ldquo;It is not the fact that it has made me
      unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;discontented, then,&rdquo; he resumed, without pause. &ldquo;Here we are.
      We do the thing we want to do&mdash;we make the kind of home for ourselves
      that we've agreed we would like&mdash;and then it turns out that somehow
      it doesn't come up to expectations. You get tired of it. I suppose, if the
      truth were known, I'm by way of being tired of it too. Well, if you look
      at it, that fact is the most important thing in the world for both of us.
      It's the one thing that we ought to be most anxious to discuss, and
      examine frankly in all its bearings&mdash;in order to see if we can't
      better it&mdash;but that's precisely the thing that doesn't get talked
      about between us. You would never have told me that you were unhappy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You use the word again,&rdquo; she reminded him, a wan smile softening her
      protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe stood up, and took a slow step toward the chair. He held her glance
      with his own, as he stood then, his head bent, gravely regarding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you tell me that you are happy?&rdquo; he asked, with sober directness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fluttered her hands in a little restrained gesture of comment. &ldquo;You
      consider only the extremes,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;Between black and white there
      are so many colours and shades and half-tones! The whole spectrum, in
      fact. Hardly anybody, I should think, gets over the edge into the true
      black or the true white. There are always tints, modifications. People are
      always inside the colour-scheme, so to speak. The worst that can be said
      of me is that I may be in the blues&mdash;in the light-blues&mdash;but it
      is fair to remember that they photograph white.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though there was an impulse within him to resent this as trifling, he
      resisted it, and judicially considered her allegory. &ldquo;That is to say&rdquo;&mdash;he
      began hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the observer I am happy. To myself I am not unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why won't you tell me, Edith, just where you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of her name was somewhat unfamiliar to their discourse. The
      intonation which his voice gave to it now caused her to look up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could tell myself,&rdquo; she answered him, after an instant's thought,
      &ldquo;pray believe that I would tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The way seemed for the moment blocked before him, and he sighed heavily.
      &ldquo;I want to get nearer to you,&rdquo; he said, with gloom, &ldquo;and I don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to her to remark: &ldquo;You take exception to my phraseology when I
      say you always try to be 'nice,' but I'm sure you know what I mean.&rdquo; She
      offered him this assurance with a tentative smile, into which he gazed
      moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't think I was 'nice' when you consented to marry me,&rdquo; he was
      suddenly inspired to say. &ldquo;I can't imagine your applying that word to me
      then in your mind. God knows what it was you did say to yourself about me,
      but you never said I was 'nice.' That was the last word that would have
      fitted me then&mdash;and now it's the only one you can think of.&rdquo; The hint
      that somehow he had stumbled upon a clue to the mysteries enveloping him
      rose to prominence in his mind as he spoke. The year had wrought a
      baffling difference in him. He lacked something now that then he had
      possessed, but he was powerless to define it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself again in the chair, and put his hand through her arm to
      keep her where she lightly rested beside him. &ldquo;Will you tell me,&rdquo; he said,
      with a kind of sombre gentleness, &ldquo;what the word is that you would have
      used then? I know you wouldn't&mdash;couldn't&mdash;have called me 'nice.'
      What would you have called me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused in silence for a little, then slipped from the chair and stood
      erect, still leaving her wrist within the restraining curve of his
      fingers. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said, musingly&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose I should have
      said 'powerful' or 'strong.'&rdquo; Then she released her arm, and in turn moved
      to the parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am weak now&mdash;I am 'nice,'&rdquo; he reflected, mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the profile he saw, as she looked away at the vast distant horizon,
      there was something pensive, even sad. She did not speak at once, and as
      he gazed at her more narrowly it seemed as if her lips were quivering. A
      new sense of her great beauty came to him&mdash;and with it a hint that
      for the instant at least her guard was down. He sprang to his feet, and
      stood beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ARE going to be open with me&mdash;Edith!&rdquo; he pleaded, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned from him a little, as if to hide the signs of her agitation.
      &ldquo;Oh, what is there to say?&rdquo; she demanded, in a tone which was almost a
      wail. &ldquo;It is not your fault. I'm not blaming you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT is not my fault?&rdquo; he persisted with patient gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she confronted him. There were the traces of tears upon her
      lashes, and serenity had fled from her face. &ldquo;It is a mistake&mdash;a
      blunder,&rdquo; she began, hurriedly. &ldquo;I take it all upon my own shoulders. I
      was the one who did it. I should have had more judgment&mdash;more good
      sense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not telling me, are you,&rdquo; he asked with gravity, &ldquo;that you are
      sorry you married me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is either of us glad?&rdquo; she retorted, breathlessly. &ldquo;What is there to be
      glad about? You are bored to death&mdash;you confess it. And I&mdash;well,
      it is not what I thought it would be. I deceived myself. I do not reproach
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you keep saying that,&rdquo; he observed, with gloomy slowness of
      utterance. &ldquo;But what is it you reproach yourself with, then? We might as
      well have it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she assented, with a swift reversion to calm. Her eyes met his with
      a glance which had in it an implacable frankness. &ldquo;I married one man
      because he would be able to make me a Duchess. I married another because
      he had eighty thousand a year. That is the kind of beast I am. There is
      bad blood in me. You know my father; that is quite enough. I am his
      daughter; that explains everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exaggeration of her tone and words produced a curious effect upon him.
      He stared at her for a little, perceiving slowly that a new personage was
      being revealed to him. The mask of delicately-balanced cynicism, of
      amiably polite indifference, had been lifted; there was a woman of flesh
      and blood beneath it, after all&mdash;a woman to whom he could talk on
      terms of intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; he said, and his big face lightened into a genial, paternal
      smile. &ldquo;You didn't marry me for my money at all! What nonsense! I simply
      came along and carried you off. You couldn't help yourself. It would have
      been the same if I hadn't had sixpence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To his sharp scrutiny there seemed to flicker in her eyes a kind of
      answering gleam. Then she hastily averted her glance, and in this action
      too there was a warrant for his mounting confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble has been,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;that I've been too much afraid of
      you. I've thought that you were made of so much finer stuff than I am,
      that you mustn't be touched. That was all a mistake. I see it right enough
      now. You ARE finer than I am&mdash;God knows there's no dispute about that&mdash;but
      that's no reason why I should have hung up signs of 'Hands off!' all
      around you, and been frightened by them myself. I had the cheek to capture
      you and carry you off&mdash;and I ought to have had the pluck to make you
      love me afterward, and keep it up. And that's what I'm going to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this declaration she offered no immediate reply, but continued to gaze
      with a vaguely meditative air upon the expanse of landscape spread below
      them. He threw a hasty glance over the windows behind him, and then with
      assurance passed his arm round her waist. He could not say that there was
      any responsive yielding to his embrace, but he did affirm to himself with
      new conviction, as he looked down upon the fair small head at his
      shoulder, with its lovely pale-brown hair drawn softly over the temples,
      and its glimpse of the matchless profile inclined beneath&mdash;that it
      was all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for a long time, with a joyous patience, for her to speak. The
      mere fact that she stood beneath his engirdling arm, and gave no thought
      to the potential servants'-eyes behind them, was enough for present
      happiness. He regarded the illimitable picture commanded from his terrace
      with refreshed eyes; it was once again the finest view in England&mdash;and
      something much more than that beside.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, abruptly, she laughed aloud&mdash;a silvery, amused little laugh
      under her breath. &ldquo;How comedy and tragedy tread forever on each other's
      heels!&rdquo; she remarked. Her tone was philosophically gay, but upon
      reflection he did not wholly like her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There wasn't any tragedy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and there isn't any comedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again. &ldquo;Oh, don't say that this doesn't appeal to your sense
      of humour!&rdquo; she urged, with mock fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe sighed in such unaffected depression at this, that she seemed
      touched by his mood. Without stirring from his hold, she lifted her face.
      &ldquo;Don't think I'm hateful,&rdquo; she bade him, and her eyes were very kind.
      &ldquo;There's more truth in what you've been saying than even you imagine. It
      really wasn't the money&mdash;or I mean it might easily have been the same
      if there had been no money. But how shall I explain it? I am attracted by
      a big, bold, strong pirate, let us say, but as soon as he has carried me
      off&mdash;that is the phrase for it&mdash;then he straightway renounces
      crime and becomes a law-abiding, peaceful citizen. My buccaneer transforms
      himself, under my very eyes, into an alderman! Do you say there is no
      comedy in that&mdash;and tragedy too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, put it that way and it's all right,&rdquo; he declared, after a moment's
      consideration. &ldquo;I've got as much fun in me as anybody else,&rdquo; he went on,
      &ldquo;only your jokes have a way of raising blisters on me, somehow. But that's
      all done with now. That's because I didn't know you&mdash;was frightened
      of you. But I aint scared any more. Everything is different!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a certain graciousness of lingering movement, she withdrew herself
      from his clasp, and faced him with a doubtful smile. &ldquo;Ah, don't be too
      sure,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is different!&rdquo; he repeated, with confident emphasis. &ldquo;Don't
      you see yourself it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say it is,&rdquo; she replied, hesitatingly, &ldquo;but that alone doesn't make
      it so. The assertion that life isn't empty doesn't fill it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but NOW you will talk with me about all that,&rdquo; he broke in
      triumphantly. &ldquo;We've been standing off with one another. We've been of no
      help to each other. But we'll change that, now. We'll talk over everything
      together. We'll make up our minds exactly what we want to do, and then
      I'll tuck you under my arm and we'll set out and do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled with kindly tolerance for his new-born enthusiasm. &ldquo;Don't count
      on me for too much wisdom or invention,&rdquo; she warned him. &ldquo;If things are to
      be done, you are still the one who will have to do them. But undoubtedly
      you are at your best when you are doing things. This really has been no
      sort of life for you, here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gathered her arm into his. &ldquo;Come and show me your greenhouses,&rdquo; he
      said, and began walking toward the end of the terrace. &ldquo;It'll turn out to
      have been all right for me, this year that I've spent here,&rdquo; he continued,
      as they strolled along. There was a delightful consciousness of new
      intimacy conveyed by the very touch of her arm, which filled his tone with
      buoyancy. &ldquo;I've been learning all sorts of tricks here, and getting myself
      into your ways of life. It's all been good training. In every way I'm a
      better man than I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had descended from the terrace to a garden path, and approached now a
      long glass structure, through the panes of which masses of soft colour&mdash;whites,
      yellows, pinks, mauves, and strange dull reds&mdash;were dimly
      perceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chrysanthemums are not up to much this year,&rdquo; Edith observed, as they
      drew near to the door of this house. &ldquo;Collins did them very badly&mdash;as
      he did most other things. But next year it will be very different.
      Gafferson is the best chrysanthemum man in England. That is he in there
      now, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe stopped short, and stared at her, the while the suggestions stirred
      by the sound of this name slowly shaped themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gafferson?&rdquo; he asked her, with a blank countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My new head-gardener,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;He was at Hadlow, and after poor
      old Lady Plowden died&mdash;why, surely you remember him there. You spoke
      about him&mdash;you'd known him somewhere&mdash;in the West Indies, wasn't
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked into vacancy with the aspect of one stupefied. &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; he
      mumbled automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with sudden decision, he swung round on the gravel. &ldquo;I've got a kind
      of headache coming on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you don't mind, we won't go inside
      among the flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      THORPE walked along, in the remoter out-of-the-way parts of the great
      gardens, as the first shadows of evening began to dull the daylight. For a
      long time he moved aimlessly about, sick at heart and benumbed of mind, in
      the stupid oppression of a bad dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      There ran through all his confused thoughts the exasperating consciousness
      that it was nonsense to be frightened, or even disturbed; that, in truth,
      nothing whatever had happened. But he could not lay hold of it to any
      comforting purpose. Some perverse force within him insisted on raising new
      phantoms in his path, and directing his reluctant gaze to their unpleasant
      shapes. Forgotten terrors pushed themselves upon his recollection. It was
      as if he stood again in the Board Room, with the telegram telling of old
      Tavender's death in his hands, waiting to hear the knock of Scotland Yard
      upon the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coming of Gafferson took on a kind of supernatural aspect, when Thorpe
      recalled its circumstances. His own curious mental ferment, which had made
      this present week a period apart in his life, had begun in the very hour
      of this man's approach to the house. His memory reconstructed a vivid
      picture of that approach&mdash;of the old ramshackle village trap, and the
      boy and the bags and the yellow tin trunk, and that decent, red-bearded,
      plebeian figure, so commonplace and yet so elusively suggestive of
      something out of the ordinary. It seemed to him now that he had at the
      time discerned a certain fateful quality in the apparition. And he and his
      wife had actually been talking of old Kervick at the moment! It was their
      disagreement over him which had prevented her explaining about the new
      head-gardener. There was an effect of the uncanny in all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what did Gafferson want? How much did he know? The idea that perhaps
      old Kervick had found him out, and patched up with him a scheme of
      blackmail, occurred to him, and in the unreal atmosphere of his mood,
      became a thing of substance. With blackmail, however, one could always
      deal; it was almost a relief to see the complication assume that guise.
      But if Gafferson was intent upon revenge and exposure instead? With such a
      slug-like, patient, tenacious fool, was that not more likely?
    </p>
    <p>
      Reasonable arguments presented themselves to his mind ever and again: his
      wife had known of Gafferson's work, and thought highly of it, and had been
      in a position to learn of his leaving Hadlow. What more natural than that
      she should hasten to employ him? And what was it, after all, that
      Gafferson could possibly know or prove? His brother-in-law had gone off,
      and got too drunk to live, and had died. What in the name of all that was
      sensible had this to do with Thorpe? Why should it even be supposed that
      Gafferson associated Thorpe with any phase of the business? And if he had
      any notion of a hostile movement, why should he have delayed action so
      long? Why indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Reassurance did not come to him, but at last an impulse to definite action
      turned his footsteps toward the cluster of greenhouses in the deepening
      shadow of the mansion. He would find Gafferson, and probe this business to
      the uttermost. If there was discoverable in the man's manner or glance the
      least evidence of a malevolent intention&mdash;he would know what to do.
      Ah, what was it that he would do? He could not say, beyond that it would
      be bad for Gafferson. He instinctively clenched the fists in the pockets
      of his jacket as he quickened his pace. Inside the congeries of glazed
      houses he was somewhat at sea. It was still light enough to make one's way
      about in the passages between the stagings, but he had no idea of the
      general plan of the buildings, and it seemed to him that he frequently got
      back to places he had traversed before. There were two or three
      subordinate gardeners in or about the houses, but upon reflection he
      forbore to question them. He tried to assume an idly indifferent air as he
      sauntered past, nodding almost imperceptible acknowledgment of the
      forefingers they jerked upward in salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came at last upon a locked door, the key of which had been removed. The
      fact vaguely surprised him, and he looked with awakened interest through
      the panes of this door. The air inside seemed slightly thickened&mdash;and
      then his eye caught the flicker of a flame, straight ahead. It was nothing
      but the fumigation of a house; the burning spirits in the lamp underneath
      the brazier were filling the structure with vapours fatal to all insect
      life. In two or three hours the men would come and open the doors and
      windows and ventilate the place. The operation was quite familiar to him;
      it had indeed interested him more when he first saw it done than had
      anything else connected with the greenhouses.
    </p>
    <p>
      His abstracted gaze happened to take note of the fact that the door-key
      was hanging on a nail overhead, and then suddenly this seemed to be
      related to something else in his thoughts&mdash;some obscure impression or
      memory which evaded him. Continuing to look at the key, a certain
      recollection all at once assumed great definiteness in his mind: it came
      to him that the labels on this patent fumigator they were using warned
      people against exposing themselves to its fumes more than was absolutely
      necessary. That meant, of course, that their full force would kill a human
      being. It was very interesting. He looked through the glass again, but
      could not see that the air was any thicker. The lamp still burned
      brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, and beheld a man, in an old cap and apron, at the further
      end of the palm-house he was in, doing something to a plant. Thorpe noted
      the fact that he felt no surprise in seeing that it was Gafferson. Somehow
      the sight of the key, and of the poison-spreading flame inside the locked
      door, seemed to have prepared him for the spectacle of Gafferson close at
      hand. He moved forward slowly toward the head-gardener, and luminous plans
      rose in his mind, ready-made at each step. He could strangle this annoying
      fool, or smother him, into non-resisting insensibility, and then put him
      inside that death-house, and let it be supposed that he had been
      asphyxiated by accident. The men when they came back would find him there.
      But ah! they would know that they had not left him there; they would have
      seen him outside, no doubt, after the fire had been lighted. Well, the key
      could be left in the unlocked door. Then it could be supposed that he had
      rashly entered, and been overcome by the vapours. He approached the man
      silently, his brain arranging the details of the deed with calm celerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then some objections to the plan rose up before him: they dealt almost
      exclusively with the social nuisance the thing would entail. There was to
      be a house-party, with that Duke and Duchess in it, of whom his wife
      talked so much, and it would be a miserable kind of bore to have a
      suffocated gardener forced upon them as a principal topic of conversation.
      Of course, too, it would more or less throw the whole household into
      confusion. And its effect upon his wife!&mdash;the progress of his
      thoughts was checked abruptly by this suggestion. A vision of the shock
      such a catastrophe might involve to her&mdash;or at the best, of the gross
      unpleasantness she would find in it&mdash;flashed over his mind, and then
      yielded to a softening, radiant consciousness of how much this meant to
      him. It seemed to efface everything else upon the instant. A profoundly
      tender desire for her happiness was in complete possession. Already the
      notion of doing anything to wound or grieve her appeared incredible to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gafferson,&rdquo; he heard himself saying, in one of the more reserved
      tones of his patriarchal manner. He had halted close to the inattentive
      man, and stood looking down upon him. His glance was at once tolerant and
      watchful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gafferson slowly rose from his slouching posture, surveyed the other while
      his faculties in leisurely fashion worked out the problem of recognition,
      aud then raised his finger to his cap-brim. &ldquo;Good-evening, sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gesture of deference was eloquently convincing. Thorpe, after an
      instant's alert scrutiny, smiled upon him. &ldquo;I was glad to hear that you
      had come to us,&rdquo; he said with benevolent affability. &ldquo;We shall expect
      great things of a man of your reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll be a fair comfort, sir,&rdquo; the other replied, &ldquo;to be in a place where
      what one does is appreciated. What use is it to succeed in hybridizing a
      Hippeastrum procera with a Pancratium Amancaes, after over six hundred
      attempts in ten years, and then spend three years a-hand-nursing the
      seedlings, and then your master won't take enough interest in the thing to
      pay your fare up to London to the exhibition with 'em? That's what 'ud
      break any man's heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; Thorpe assented, with patrician kindliness. &ldquo;You need fear
      nothing of that sort here, Gafferson. We give you a free hand. Whatever
      you want, you have only to let us know. And you can't do things too well
      to please us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Gafferson, and really, as Thorpe
      thought about it, the interview seemed at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master turned upon his heel, with a brief, oblique nod over his
      shoulder, and made his way out into the open air. Here, as he walked, he
      drew a succession of long consolatory breaths. It was almost as if he had
      emerged from the lethal presence of the fumigator itself. He took the
      largest cigar from his case, lighted it, and sighed smoke-laden new relief
      as he strolled back toward the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a few minutes before he had been struggling helplessly in the coils of
      an evil nightmare. These terrors seemed infinitely far behind him now. He
      gave an indifferent parting glance backward at them, as one might over his
      after-breakfast cigar at the confused alarms of an early awakening hours
      before. There was nothing worth remembering&mdash;only the shapeless and
      foolish burden of a bad dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assurance rose within him that he was not to have any more such
      trouble. With a singular clearness of mental vision he perceived that the
      part of him which brought bad dreams had been sloughed off, like a
      serpent's skin. There had been two Thorpes, and one of them&mdash;the
      Thorpe who had always been willing to profit by knavery, and at last in a
      splendid coup as a master thief had stolen nearly a million, and would
      have shrunk not at all from adding murder to the rest, to protect that
      plunder&mdash;this vicious Thorpe had gone away altogether. There was no
      longer a place for him in life; he would never be seen again by mortal
      eye....There remained only the good Thorpe, the pleasant, well-intentioned
      opulent gentleman; the excellent citizen; the beneficent master, to whom,
      even Gafferson like the others, touched a respectful forelock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It passed in the procession of his reverie as a kind of triumph of virtue
      that the good Thorpe retained the fortune which the bad Thorpe had stolen.
      It was in all senses a fortunate fact, because now it would be put to
      worthy uses. Considering that he had but dimly drifted about heretofore on
      the outskirts of the altruistic impulse, it was surprisingly plain to him
      now that he intended to be a philanthropist. Even as he mentioned the word
      to himself, the possibilities suggested by it expanded in his thoughts.
      His old dormant, formless lust for power stirred again in his pulses. What
      other phase of power carried with it such rewards, such gratitudes, such
      humble subservience on all sides as far as the eye could reach&mdash;as
      that exercised by the intelligently munificent philanthropist?
    </p>
    <p>
      Intelligence! that was the note of it all. Many rich people dabbled at the
      giving of money, but they did it so stupidly, in such a slip-shod fashion,
      that they got no credit for it. Even millionaires more or less in public
      life, great newspaper-owners, great brewer-peers, and the like, men who
      should know how to do things well, gave huge sums in bulk for public
      charities, such as the housing of the poor, and yet contrived somehow to
      let the kudos that should have been theirs evaporate. He would make no
      such mistake as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy enough to see wherein they erred. They gave superciliously,
      handing down their alms from a top lofty altitude of Tory superiority, and
      the Radicals down below sniffed or growled even while they grudgingly took
      these gifts&mdash;that was all nonsense. These aristocratic or
      tuft-hunting philanthropists were the veriest duffers. They laid out
      millions of pounds in the vain attempt to secure what might easily be had
      for mere thousands, if they went sensibly to work. Their vast benefactions
      yielded them at the most bare thanks, or more often no thanks at all,
      because they lacked the wit to lay aside certain little trivial but
      annoying pretensions, and waive a few empty prejudices. They went on, year
      after year, tossing their fortunes into a sink of contemptuous
      ingratitude, wondering feebly why they were not beloved in return. It was
      because they were fools. They could not, or they would not, understand the
      people they sought to manipulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could not a man of real brain, of real breadth and energy and force
      of character, do in London with two hundred thousand pounds? Why, he could
      make himself master of the town! He could break into fragments the
      political ascendency of the snob, &ldquo;semi-detached&rdquo; villa classes, in half
      the Parliamentary divisions they now controlled. He could reverse the
      partisan complexion of the Metropolitan delegation, and lead to
      Westminster a party of his own, a solid phalanx of disciplined men,
      standing for the implacable Democracy of reawakened London. With such a
      backing, he could coerce ministries at will, and remake the politics of
      England. The role of Great Oliver himself was not too hopelessly beyond
      the scope of such a vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe threw his cigar-end aside, and then noted that it was almost dark.
      He strode up to the terrace two steps at a time, and swung along its
      length with a vigour and exhilaration of movement he had not known, it
      seemed to him, for years. He felt the excitement of a new incentive
      bubbling in his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her Ladyship is in her sitting-room, sir,&rdquo; a domestic replied to his
      enquiry in the hall. The title arrested his attention from some fresh
      point of view, and he pondered it, as he made his way along the corridor,
      and knocked at a door. At the sound of a voice he pushed open the door,
      and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage, looking up, noted, with aroused interest, a marked change
      in his carriage. He stood aggressively erect, his big shoulders squared,
      and his head held high. On his massive face there was the smile, at once
      buoyant and contained, of a strong man satisfied with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something impelled her to rise, and to put a certain wistfulness of
      enquiry into her answering smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your headache is better then?&rdquo; she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked puzzled for a moment, then laughed lightly. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he
      answered. Advancing, he caught her suddenly, almost vehemently, in his
      arms, aud covered the face that was perforce upturned with kisses. When
      she was released from this overwhelming embrace, and stood panting and
      flushed, regarding him with narrowed, intent eyes, in which mystification
      was mellowed by the gleam of not-displeased curiosity, he preferred a
      request which completed her bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Thorpe,&rdquo; he began, with significant deliberation, but smiling with
      his eyes to show the tenderness underlying his words&mdash;&ldquo;would you mind
      if we didn't dress for dinner this evening, and if we dined in the little
      breakfast-room&mdash;or here, for that matter&mdash;instead of the big
      place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, not at all, if you wish it,&rdquo; she answered readily enough, but
      viewing him still with a puzzled glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm full of new ideas,&rdquo; he explained, impulsively impatient of the
      necessity to arrange a sequence among his thoughts. &ldquo;I see great things
      ahead. It's all come to me in a minute, but I couldn't see it clearer if
      I'd thought it out for a year. Perhaps I was thinking of it all the time
      and didn't know it. But anyhow, I see my way straight ahead. You don't
      know what it means to me to have something to do. It makes another man of
      me, just to think about it. Another man?&mdash;yes, twenty men! It's a
      thing that can be done, and by God! I'm going to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She beheld in his face, as she scrutinized it, a stormy glow of the man's
      native, coarse, imperious virility, reasserting itself through the mask of
      torpor which this vacuous year had superimposed. The large features were
      somehow grown larger still; they dominated the countenance as rough bold
      headlands dominate a shore. It was the visage of a conqueror&mdash;of a
      man gathering within himself, to expend upon his fellows, the appetites,
      energies, insensibilities, audacities of a beast of prey. Her glance
      fluttered a little, and almost quailed, before the frank barbarism of
      power in the look he bent upon her. Then it came to her that something
      more was to be read in this look; there was in it a reservation of
      magnanimity, of protection, of entreating invitation, for her special
      self. He might tear down with his claws, and pull to pieces and devour
      others; but his mate he would shelter and defend and love with all his
      strength. An involuntary trembling thrill ran through her&mdash;and then
      she smiled up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you're going to do?&rdquo; she asked him, mechanically. Her mind
      roved far afield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rule England!&rdquo; he told her with gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment there seemed to her nothing positively incongruous in the
      statement. To look at him, as he loomed before her, uplifted by his
      refreshed and soaring self-confidence, it appeared not easy to say what
      would be impossible to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, after a fleeting pause, with a plainer note of
      good-fellowship than he had ever heard in her voice before. &ldquo;Delightful,&rdquo;
       she said gayly. &ldquo;But I'm not sure that I quite understand the&mdash;the
      precise connection of morning-dress and dinner in a small room with the
      project.&rdquo; He nodded pleased comprehension of the spirit in which she took
      him. &ldquo;Just a whim,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The things I've got in mind don't fit
      at all with ceremony, and that big barn of a room, and men standing about.
      What I want more than anything else is a quiet snug little evening with
      you alone, where I can talk to you and&mdash;and we can be together by
      ourselves. You'd like it, wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, and there was a novel confession of embarrassment in her
      mantling colour and down-spread lashes. It had always to his eyes been,
      from the moment he first beheld it, the most beautiful face in the world&mdash;exquisitely
      matchless in its form and delicacy of line and serene yet sensitive grace.
      But he had not seen in it before, or guessed that there could come to it,
      this crowning added loveliness of feminine confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would like it, wouldn't you?&rdquo; he repeated in a lower, more strenuous
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her eyes slowly, and looked, not into his, but over his
      shoulder, as in a reverie, half meditation, half languorous dreaming. She
      swayed rather than stepped toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she answered, in a musing murmur,&mdash;&ldquo;I think I shall like&mdash;everything.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      THORPE found the Duke of Glastonbury a much more interesting person to
      watch and to talk with, both during the dinner Saturday evening and later,
      than he had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was young, and slight of frame, and not at all imposing in stature, but
      he bore himself with a certain shy courtliness of carriage which had a
      distinction of its own. His face, with its little black moustache and
      large dark eyes, was fine upon examination, but in some elusively foreign
      way. There lingered a foreign note, too, in the way he talked. His speech
      was English enough to the ear, it was true, but it was the considered
      English of a book, and its phrases had a deftness which was hardly native.
      He looked, if not a sad young man, then one conscious always of sufficient
      reasons for sadness, but one came, after a time, to see that the mood
      beneath was not melancholy. It had even its sprightly side, which shone
      out irregularly in his glance and talk, from a sober mean of amiable
      weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe knew his extraordinary story&mdash;that of a poor tutor, earning
      his living in ignorance of the fact that he had a birthright of any sort,
      who had been miraculously translated into the heir, not only to an ancient
      title but to vast collateral wealth. He had been born and reared in
      France, and it was there that the heralds of this stupendous change in his
      affairs had found him out. There was a good deal more to the story,
      including numerous unsavoury legends about people now many years dead, and
      it was impossible to observe the young Duke and not seem to perceive signs
      that he was still nervously conscious of these legends. The story of his
      wife&mdash;a serene, grey-eyed, rather silent young person, with a pale
      face of some beauty, and with much purity and intellect&mdash;was strange
      enough to match. She also had earned her own living, as a private
      secretary or type-writing girl, or something of the sort, and her husband
      had deliberately chosen her after he had come into his title. One might
      study her very closely, however, and catch no hint that these facts in any
      degree disconcerted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe studied her a good deal, in a furtive way, with a curiosity born of
      his knowledge that the Duke had preferred her, when he might have married
      his widowed cousin, who was now Thorpe's own wife. How he had come to know
      this, he could never have told. He had breathed it in, somehow, with the
      gossip-laden atmosphere of that one London season of his. It was patent
      enough, too, that his wife&mdash;his Edith&mdash;had not only liked this
      ducal youngster very much, but still entertained toward him a considerable
      affection. She had never dissembled this feeling, and it visibly informed
      her glance and manner now, at her own table, when she turned to speak with
      him, where he sat at her right hand. Thorpe had never dreamed of thinking
      ill of his wife's friendship, even when her indifference to what he
      thought had been most taken for granted. Now that this was all changed,
      and the amazing new glory of a lover had enveloped him, he had a distinct
      delight in watching the myriad charming phases of her kind manner,
      half-sisterly, half-motherly, toward the grave-faced young man. It was all
      a part of the delicious change which these past few days had wrought in
      her, this warm and supple softness of mien, of eye and smile and voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how the Duke, if really he had had a chance to marry Edith, could have
      taken the type-writer instead, baffled speculation. Thorpe gave more
      attention to this problem, during dinner, than he did to the conversation
      of the table. His exchange of sporadic remarks with the young Duchess
      beside him was indeed an openly perfunctory affair, which left him
      abundant leisure to contemplate her profile in silence, while she turned
      to listen to the general talk, of which Miss Madden and the Hon. Winifred
      Plowden bore the chief burden. The talk of these ladies interested him but
      indifferently, though the frequent laughter suggested that it was amusing.
      He looked from his wife to the Duchess and back again, in ever-recurring
      surprise that the coronet had been carried past Edith. And once he looked
      a long time at his wife and the Duke, and formulated the theory that she
      must have refused him. No doubt that was why she had been sympathetically
      fond of him ever since, and was being so nice to him now. Yes&mdash;clearly
      that was it. He felt upon this that he also liked the Duke very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by no means so apparent that the Duke liked him. Both he and his
      Duchess, indeed, were scrupulously and even deferentially polite, but
      there was a painstaking effect about it, which, seemingly, they lacked the
      art altogether to conceal. It seemed to Thorpe that the other guests
      unconsciously took their cue from this august couple, and all exposed
      somewhat the effort their civility to him involved. At another time the
      suspicion of this would have stung him. He had only to glance across the
      table to where his wife sat now, and it was all right. What other people
      thought of him&mdash;how other people liked or disliked him&mdash;was of
      no earthly importance. Whenever he chose to exert himself, he could compel
      from them the behaviour that he desired. It was their dull inability to
      read character which prompted them to regard him as merely a rich outsider
      who had married Edith Cressage. He viewed with a comfortable tolerance
      this infirmity of theirs. When the time came, if he wanted to do so, he
      could awaken them to their delusion as by forked lightning and the burst
      of thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whim came to him, and expanded swiftly into a determination, to
      contrive some intimate talk forthwith with the Duke. The young man seemed
      both clever and sensible, and in a way impressionable as well. Thorpe
      thought that he would probably have some interesting things to say, but
      still more he thought of him as a likely listener. It would be the easier
      to detach him from the company, since the occasion was one of studied
      informality. The Duke did not go about in society, in the ordinary sense
      of the word, and he would not have come to High Thorpe to meet a large
      party. He was here as a kinsman and friend of his hostess for a quiet
      week; and the few other guests fitted readily enough into the picture of a
      family gathering. The spirit of domesticity had indeed so obviously
      descended upon the little group in the drawing-room, an hour or so after
      dinner, that Thorpe felt it quite the natural thing to put his arm through
      that of the Duke and lead him off to his personal smoking-room. He even
      published his intention by audibly bidding the Hon. Balder Plowden to
      remain with the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two had seated themselves in soft, low easy-chairs, and the host
      had noted with pleasure that his guest had no effeminate qualms in the
      matter of large rich cigars, a brief silence ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very anxious to get your views on a certain subject,&rdquo; Thorpe was
      inspired to begin, bluntly pushing preliminaries aside. &ldquo;If a man of
      fortune wishes to do genuine good with his money, here in England, how
      should he best go about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke looked up at his questioner, with a sudden flash of surprise on
      his dark, mobile face. He hesitated a moment, and smiled a little. &ldquo;You
      ask of me the sum of human wisdom,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is the hardest of all
      problems; no one solves it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe nodded his big head comprehendingly. &ldquo;That's all the more reason
      why it ought to be solved,&rdquo; he declared, with slow emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other expressed by look and tone an augmented consciousness of the
      unexpected. &ldquo;I did not know,&rdquo; he remarked cautiously, &ldquo;that this was a
      matter in which you were specially concerned. It pleases me very much to
      hear it. Even if the solution does not come, it is well to have as many as
      possible turning the problem over in their minds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I'm going to solve it!&rdquo; Thorpe told him, with round confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke pulled contemplatively at his cigar for a little. &ldquo;Do not think
      me a cynic,&rdquo; he began at last. &ldquo;You are a man of affairs; you have made
      your own way; you should be even more free from illusions than I am. If
      you tell me that these good things can be done, I am the last one to
      dispute you. But I have seen near at hand experiments of exceptional
      importance, on a very grand scale, and the result does not encourage me. I
      come to doubt indeed if money has any such power in these affairs as we
      think it has&mdash;for that matter, if it has any power at all. The
      shifting of money can always disorganize what is going on at the moment&mdash;change
      it about and alter it in many ways&mdash;but its effect is only temporary.
      As soon as the pressure is released, the human atoms rearrange themselves
      as they were before, and the old conditions return. I think the only force
      which really makes any permanent difference is character&mdash;and yet
      about even that I am not sure. The best man I have ever known&mdash;and in
      many respects the ablest&mdash;devoted untold energy and labour, and much
      money, too, to the service of a few thousand people in Somerset, on land
      of his own, upon a theory wonderfully elaborated and worked out. Perhaps
      you have heard of Emanuel Torr and his colony, his System?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had worked tremendously for years at it. He fell ill and went away&mdash;and
      in a day all the results of his labours and outlay were flat on the
      ground. The property is mine now, and it is farmed and managed again in
      the ordinary way, and really the people there seem already to have
      forgotten that they had a prophet among them. The marvelous character of
      the man&mdash;you look in vain for any sign of an impress that it left
      upon them. I never go there. I cannot bear those people. I have sometimes
      the feeling that if it were feasible I should like to oppress them in some
      way&mdash;to hurt them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! 'the people' are hogs, right enough,&rdquo; Thorpe commented genially, &ldquo;but
      they ARE 'the people,' and they're the only tools we've got to work with
      to make the world go round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you leave the world alone,&rdquo; objected the Duke, &ldquo;it goes round of
      itself. And if you don't leave it alone, it goes round just the same,
      without any reference whatever to your exertions. Some few men are always
      cleverer or noisier or more restless than the others, and their activity
      produces certain deviations and peculiarities in their generation. The
      record of these&mdash;generally a very faulty and foolish record&mdash;we
      call history. We say of these movements in the past that some of them were
      good and some were bad. Our sons very likely will differ totally from us
      about which were good and which were bad; quite possibly, in turn, their
      sons may agree with us. I do not see that it matters. We cannot treat
      anything as final&mdash;except that the world goes round. We appear out of
      the darkness at one edge of it; we are carried across and pitched off into
      the darkness at the other edge of it. We are certain about nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except that some of us have to pay for our ride, and others don't,&rdquo; put
      in Thorpe. The tone in which he spoke made his meaning so clear that his
      Grace sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you think we do not pay?&rdquo; he queried, his countenance brightening
      with the animation of debate. &ldquo;My dear sir, we pay more than anyone else.
      Our fares are graduated, just as our death-duties are. No doubt there are
      some idle and stupid, thick-skinned rich fellows, who escape the
      ticket-collector. But for each of them there are a thousand idle poor
      fellows who do the same. You, for example, are a man of large wealth. I,
      for my sins, carry upon my back the burden of a prodigious fortune. Could
      we not go out now, and walk down the road to your nearest village, and
      find in the pub, there a dozen day-labourers happier than we are? Why&mdash;it
      is Saturday night. Then I will not say a dozen, but as many as the tap
      will hold. It is not the beer alone that makes them happy. Do not think
      that. It is the ability to rest untroubled, the sense that till Monday
      they have no more responsibility than a tree-toad. Does the coming of
      Sunday make that difference to you or to me? When night comes, does it
      mean to us that we are to sleep off into oblivion all we have done that
      day, and begin life afresh next morning? No-o! We are the tired people;
      the load is never lifted from our backs. Ah, do we not pay indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-ho!&rdquo; ejaculated Thorpe. He had been listening with growing
      astonishment to the other's confession. He was still surprised as he
      spoke, but a note of satisfaction mounted into his voice as he went on.
      &ldquo;You are unhappy, too! You are a young man, in excellent health; you have
      the wife you want; you understand good tobacco; you have a son. That is a
      great deal&mdash;but my God! think what else you've got. You're the Duke
      of Glastonbury&mdash;one of the oldest titles in England. You're one of
      the richest men in the country&mdash;the richest in the old peerage, at
      any rate, I'm told. And YOU'RE not happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled. &ldquo;Ah, the terms and forms survive,&rdquo; he said, with a kind
      of pedagogic affability, &ldquo;after the substance has disappeared. The
      nobleman, the prince, was a great person in the times when he monopolized
      wealth. It enabled him to monopolize almost everything else that was
      pleasant or superb. He had the arts and the books and the musicians and
      the silks and velvets, and the bath-tubs&mdash;everything that made
      existence gorgeous&mdash;all to himself. He had war to amuse himself with,
      and the seven deadly sins. The barriers are down now. Everything which
      used to be exclusively the nobleman's is now within everybody's reach,
      including the sins. And it is not only that others have levelled up to
      him; they have levelled him down. He cannot dress now more expensively
      than other people. Gambling used to be recognized as one of his normal
      relaxations, but now, the higher his rank, the more sharply he is scolded
      for it. Naturally he does not know what to do with himself. As an
      institution, he descends from a period when the only imaginable use for
      wealth was to be magnificent with it. But now in this business age, where
      the recognized use of wealth is to make more wealth, he is so much out of
      place that he has even forgotten how to be magnificent. There are some
      illustrated articles in one of the magazines, giving photographs of the
      great historic country-houses of England. You should see the pictures of
      the interiors. The furniture and decorations are precisely what a Brixton
      dressmaker would buy, if she suddenly came into some money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Thorpe stuck to his point, &ldquo;you are not happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke frowned faintly, as if at the other's persistency. Then he
      shrugged his shoulders and answered in a lighter tone. &ldquo;It hardly amounts
      to that, I think. I confess that there are alleviations to my lot. In the
      opinion of the world I am one of its most fortunate citizens&mdash;and it
      is not for me to say that the world is altogether wrong. The chief point
      is&mdash;I don't know if you will quite follow me&mdash;there are limits
      to what position and fortune can give a man. And so easily they may
      deprive him of pleasures which poorer men enjoy! I may be wrong, but it
      seems impossible to me that any rich man who has acres of gardens and
      vineries and glass can get up the same affection for it all that the
      cottager will have for his little flower-plot, that he tends with his own
      hands. One seems outside the realities of life&mdash;a mere spectator at
      the show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but why not DO things?&rdquo; Thorpe demanded of him. &ldquo;Why merely stand, as
      you say, and look on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other leant his head back again. &ldquo;Pray what do you recommend?&rdquo; he
      asked almost listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;politics, for example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke nodded, with an air of according to the suggestion a certain
      respect. &ldquo;Unhappily I am too much of a foreigner,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;I know
      Englishmen and their affairs too imperfectly. Sometime&mdash;perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And philanthropic work&mdash;you don't care about that,&rdquo; pursued the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;we go not so far as that,&rdquo; said his Grace, with a deprecatory
      wave of the hands. &ldquo;My wife finds many interests in it, only she would not
      like to have you call it philanthropical. She is London-born, and it is a
      great pleasure to her to be of assistance to poorer young women in London,
      who have so little done for them by the community, and can do so little
      for themselves. I am much less skeptical about that particular work, I may
      tell you, than about philanthropy in general. In fact, I am quite clear
      that it is doing good. At least it is doing a kindness, and that is a
      pleasant occupation. We are really not so idle as one might think. We work
      at it a good deal, my wife and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I London-born,&rdquo; Thorpe remarked, with a certain irrelevancy. After
      a moment's pause he turned a sharply enquiring glance upon his guest.
      &ldquo;This thing that you're doing in London&mdash;does it give you any 'pull'
      there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Pull?&rdquo; repeated the other helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there was something you wanted the people of London to do, would they
      do it for you because of what you've been doing for them&mdash;or for
      their girls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke looked puzzled for a moment. &ldquo;But it isn't conceivable that I
      should want London to do anything&mdash;unless it might be to consume its
      own smoke,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; said Thorpe, rising bulkily to his feet, but signifying by a
      gesture that his companion was to remain seated. He puffed at his cigar
      till its tip gleamed angrily through the smoke about him, and moved a few
      steps with his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;That is what I wanted to get at. Now
      I'm London-born, I've got the town in my blood. The Thorpes have been
      booksellers there for generations. The old name is over the old shop
      still. I think I know what Londoners are like; I ought to. It's my belief
      that they don't want gifts. They'll take 'em, but it isn't what they want.
      They're a trading people&mdash;one of the oldest in the world. Commercial
      traditions, the merchant's pride&mdash;these are bred in their bones. They
      don't want something for nothing. They like an honest bargain&mdash;fair
      on both sides. 'You help me and I'll help you.' And it's the only way you
      can do anything worth doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Duke, passively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorpe halted, and still with the cigar between his teeth, looked down at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can go into London, and study out the things that are to be done&mdash;that
      need to be done&mdash;and divide these into two parts, those that belong
      to private enterprise and those that ought to be done publicly. And I can
      say to Londoners&mdash;not in so many words, mind you, but in a way the
      sharper ones will understand: 'Here, you fellows. I'll begin doing out of
      my own pocket one set of these things, and you in turn must put yourselves
      at my back, and stand by me, and put me in a position where I can make the
      Government do this other set of things.' That will appeal to them. A poor
      man couldn't lead them any distance, because he could always be killed by
      the cry that he was filling his pockets. They will believe in a man whose
      ambition is to win an earldom and five thousand a year out of politics,
      but they will stone to death the man who merely tries to get a few
      hundreds a year out of it for his wife and children. And a man like you
      can't do anything in London, because they can't see that there's anything
      you want in return&mdash;and besides, in their hearts, they don't like
      your class. Don't forget it! This is the city that chopped off the king's
      head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but this is also the city,&rdquo; retorted the other, with placid pleasure
      in his argument, &ldquo;which decked itself in banners and ribbons to welcome
      back the son of that same king. And if you think of it, he was rather a
      quaint thing in sons, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the women did that,&rdquo; Thorpe affirmed with readiness. &ldquo;They get
      their own way once in a while, when the men are tired out, and they have
      their little spell of nonsense and monkey-shines, but it never lasts long.
      Charles II. doesn't matter at all&mdash;but take my word for it, his
      father matters a great deal. There was a Thorpe among the judges who voted
      to behead him. I am descended in a straight line from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Grace shrugged his slight shoulders again. &ldquo;It happens that my
      ancestors had extremely large facilities for doing unpleasant things, and,
      God knows, they did them&mdash;but I don't quite see what that goes to
      prove, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don't grasp the idea,&rdquo; said Thorpe, resignedly. After a moment's
      pause he took the cigar from his lips, and straightened himself &ldquo;All the
      same,&rdquo; he declared roundly, &ldquo;I am going to do the trick. London has been
      waiting for an organizer&mdash;a leader&mdash;for a hundred years. The
      right kind of a man, going the right way to work, can stand London on its
      head, as surely as I can burn this cigar. And I'm going to have a try at
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very interesting,&rdquo; remarked the Duke, with vagueness. &ldquo;But&mdash;are
      the ladies waiting for us? And if so, aren't we keeping them up
      unconscionably?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if in comment upon his words, there was the sound of a faint rap at the
      door. Then it opened, and through the dense blue haze of the room they saw
      some shadowed forms softly indistinct save where the light from the
      ceiling outside shone down upon a group of coiffured heads. A noise of
      mingled coughing and laughter specifically completed the introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm&mdash;it's unendurable in there,&rdquo; spoke the voice of the hostess.
      &ldquo;We WERE coming in to smoke with you,&rdquo; she called out through the cloud,
      &ldquo;since you wouldn't stop with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along!&rdquo; answered Thorpe, cheerily. He strode to the end of the room
      and raised a window. From the same corner he turned on some added lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this more effective illumination, the lady of the house advanced,
      with Miss Madden and the Hon. Winifred close behind her. &ldquo;Frank has gone
      to bed,&rdquo; she explained to the Duke, who had risen. Then she turned to her
      husband a bright-eyed glance: &ldquo;You don't mind&mdash;our coming?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind!&rdquo; he called out, with robust impressiveness. &ldquo;Mind!&rdquo; As if to
      complete the expression of his meaning, he threw his arm loosely about
      her, where she stood, and brought her to his side. They remained standing
      thus, before the fireplace, after the others were all seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Thorpe has been outlining to me the most wonderful plans,&rdquo; said the
      Duke, looking from one face to another, with a reserved smile. &ldquo;It seems
      that philanthropy fails unless it is combined with very advanced politics.
      It is a new idea to me&mdash;but he certainly states it with vigour. Do
      you understand it, Edith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, perfectly,&rdquo; replied the wife, smilingly. &ldquo;I am his first convert.
      Behold in me the original disciple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst of that is,&rdquo; commented Thorpe, with radiant joviality, &ldquo;she
      would subscribe to any other new doctrine of mine just as readily.&rdquo; He
      tightened the arm encircling her by a perceptible trifle. &ldquo;Wouldn't you,
      sweetheart?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed in nowise embarrassed by these overt endearments. There was
      indeed the dimmest suggestion in her face and voice of a responsive mood.
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she began, with a soft glance, half-deprecation, half-pride,
      bent upon the others, and with thoughtful deliberation,&mdash;&ldquo;really the
      important thing is that he should pursue some object&mdash;have in view
      something that he is determined to master. Without that, he is not
      contented&mdash;not at his best. He should have been a soldier. He has a
      passion for battle in his blood. And now that he sees something he is
      eager to do&mdash;I am very glad. It makes it none the less acceptable
      that good is to come from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still maintain,&rdquo; said Miss Madden, interpolating her words through the
      task of lighting a cigarette, and contriving for them an effect of
      drollery which appealed to Thorpe most of all&mdash;&ldquo;I shall always
      insist, just the same, that crime was his true vocation.&rdquo;
     </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
